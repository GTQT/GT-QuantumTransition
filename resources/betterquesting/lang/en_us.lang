gtqt.quest.db.16.desc=In the early stages of the game, trees are obviously your most important resource. You should be glad you weren't born in Dog Bear Ridge, and that there are no two bears and two monkeys bothering you while you chop trees. However, planting trees after felling them is still something you need to pay attention to.%n%nIt is highly recommended that you plant rubber trees. This is an industrial tree, and you will need a lot of rubber in the future.%n%nAdditionally, if you synthesize an apple tree using an apple and an oak sapling, it will provide you with a steady supply of apples once it grows up. Isn't that great?

gtqt.quest.db.23.title=How to Use Fluid Pipes
gtqt.quest.db.23.desc=Introduction and Manufacturing Methods%nFluid pipes made from various materials, with individual micro, small, medium and large fluid pipes containing materials equivalent to ½ (72 mB), 1 (144 mB), 3 (432 mB) and 6 ingots (864 mB) respectively. Can be manufactured by the following methods:%n%nFor fluid pipes of any size, they can be manufactured in a press by processing ingots of the corresponding material with the die head (micro pipe), die head (small pipe), die head (pipe) or die head (large pipe). Among them, manufacturing micro fluid pipes or small fluid pipes in a press will cause an additional 50%% resource waste, while manufacturing fluid pipes of other sizes will not result in waste. Wooden fluid pipes cannot be manufactured in a press;%n%nSmall fluid pipes and fluid pipes can also be directly synthesized by using plates of the corresponding material in conjunction with a forging hammer and file.%n%nFluid Transport%n%nPipe Properties%nAs the name suggests, fluid pipes are mainly used for transporting fluids. Fluid pipes made of different materials have different transport rates and temperature limits. The table below lists all the fluid pipes newly added in the original GTCE and the relevant attribute information of medium fluid pipes of the material.%n%nMaterial Transport Rate Temperature Limit Material Transport Rate Temperature Limit%nBronze 140 mB/t 2,000 K%nSteel 200 mB/t 2,500 K%nCopper 100 mB/t 1,000 K%nTitanium 800 mB/t 5,000 K%nPolyethylene 800 mB/t 350 K%nTungsten Steel 1,200 mB/t 7,500 K%nPolytetrafluoroethylene 800 mB/t 600 K%nWood 80 mB/t 310 K%nStainless Steel 400 mB/t 3,000 K%n%nThe transport rates of micro, small and large fluid pipes are 25%%, 50%% and 200%% of the transport rate of the corresponding medium fluid pipe of the material respectively; the temperature limits that fluid pipes of different materials can withstand are not affected by their size.%n%nTransport Mechanism%nWhen a fluid pipe is placed, its six faces will automatically connect to the faces of adjacent blocks that can interact with fluids. Holding a wrench and pressing the use key (default is right mouse button) on any face of the fluid pipe can adjust the configuration of that face, disconnecting it from the corresponding face. Pressing the use key again with the wrench on the corresponding face of the fluid pipe can restore the connection.%n%nFluid pipes have their own buffer space, each grid of fluid pipe is equal to its own transport rate value, and connected fluid pipes share buffer space. Fluid pipes cannot actively draw fluids from the faces they are connected to, but they can actively output the fluids stored in them to the blocks they are connected to. Therefore, fluid pipes usually need to be used in conjunction with electric pumps of different voltage levels that can automatically draw fluids from containers, or by directly connecting the fluid pipe to the automatic output face of a machine. Similarly, fluid pipes can also be used in conjunction with fluid filters, fan boards and other fluid transport related cover boards.%n%nUsage Restrictions%nIf the temperature of the fluid input into the fluid pipe exceeds the temperature limit it can withstand, the fluid pipe block will be burned due to overheating and replaced by fire (if placement of fire is allowed at that position). Wooden fluid pipes cannot be used to transport gaseous fluids, otherwise the fluid pipe block will disappear and there is a chance that a small explosion that does not destroy blocks will occur at the original location.%n%nFluid pipes of different materials and sizes cannot transfer fluids between each other.%n%nWhen the fluid in the buffer space of a fluid pipe is greater than or equal to 373 K (100 ℃, the temperature at which water boils under normal conditions), every 20 ticks will cause ( (fluid temperature - 363) ÷ 4.0 ) points of damage to creatures at the block where the fluid pipe is located. The prompt when a creature dies due to this reason is: “[Creature Name]'s brain was burned”.%n%nWhen the fluid in the buffer space of a fluid pipe is less than or equal to 183 K (-90 ℃, the freezing temperature of most gases under normal conditions), every 20 ticks will cause ( fluid temperature ÷ 4.0 ) points of damage to creatures at the block where the fluid pipe is located. The prompt when a creature dies due to this reason is: “[Creature Name] froze to death”.%n%nOther Uses%nFluid pipes of different materials and sizes can also directly participate in the manufacture of some machines. For example:%n%nFluid pipes made of bronze and steel can be used to synthesize various steam machines and high-pressure steam machines;%n%nLarge stainless steel fluid pipes can be directly used to synthesize the controller block of the multi-block machine distillation tower;%n%nThe synthesis of presses of different voltage levels requires consuming 1 fluid pipe suitable for the corresponding voltage level, etc.%n%nRedundant fluid pipes can be recycled in a grinder, arc furnace, plasma arc furnace or fluid extractor. Among them, recycling micro fluid pipes in a grinder, arc furnace or plasma arc furnace will cause 1/9 resource waste.

gtqt.quest.db.25.title=How to use Item Pipes
gtqt.quest.db.25.desc=Ordinary item pipes。%n%nThere are two parameters: "Resistance Value" and "Transfer Speed"。%n%nThe sum of the resistance values of all item pipes from Container A to Container B is the actual resistance value。During transfer, the place with the lower resistance value always has priority until its storage space is full。%n%nThe transfer speed is usually labeled as "X groups/second"。This group is actually "one item stack" (the original meaning of stack) rather than 64 or some other number。In the container, if an item occupies one item slot, that slot can be considered as one item stack。If more of the same item occupies different slots, they will still be regarded as multiple stacks during transfer。%n%nThe transfer speed follows the barrel principle, meaning the actual transfer rate depends on the slowest one in the pipeline network。

gtqt.quest.db.59.title=Steel Pipe
gtqt.quest.db.59.desc=Why can't my pipes automatically connect? In order to make pipes more intelligent, the mod has made changes to them. Now you can use a wrench to connect only the desired pipes. You don't need a plate or foil to prevent pipe connections. If you build one pipe onto another, the pipes will still automatically connect.%n%nPipes that carry anything above a certain temperature, such as steam, will harm players that come in contact with them. You may want to cover hot pipes to prevent injuries. Additionally, if the heat level exceeds the pipe's heat capacity, the pipe will melt.%n%nIf you hold a wrench and aim at a pipe, you will see a 3*3 grid. Right-clicking on the pipe in the center of the grid with the wrench will enable or disable the connection. If the connection is enabled, it will have an X through it. You can perform the same operation on any of the 4 corners to adjust the opposite side. Similarly, each of the 4 edges can be connected by clicking the nearest box in the grid.%n%nPipes attempt to transfer half their capacity twice per second, so the total capacity per second is full capacity.%n%nLarge or giant fluid pipes can serve as poor man's storage tanks, individually holding a large amount of fluid.
gtqt.quest.db.60.title=Introduction to Mineral Veins
gtqt.quest.db.60.desc=§6This quest will help you mine the unique veins from GregTech! Look at me, look at me.§r%n%nPart1: What is a vein%n%nAll vanilla (including vanilla from other mods) ores, such as iron ore, copper ore, charged certus quartz ore, etc., have their generation disabled, and you will not be able to see them in the game in the normal way. However, GregTech veins, which are denser and contain precious byproducts, will be your best source for obtaining minerals. %n%nGTQT veins have been modified, making them denser than regular GregTech veins: they generally cover a large area underground within a 3x3 chunk range and extend towards the Earth"s core as they are mined, with considerable depth span. Above the main vein lies a thin layer of 👶 ore, and below it is the main ore body. %n%nIncluding oil and natural gas, GregTech generates the following types of mineral veins in total: %n%n1. Layered veins: minerals that are clearly divided into upper, middle, and lower layers along with randomly generated minerals. This was once the most common vein type. Generally, you only need to mine the corresponding layer and ignore the ores in the other layers that you don"t want. For example, if you only need copper in a chalcopyrite vein, mining the upper layer will suffice. %n%n2. Mixed veins: several types of minerals mixed together. (There are almost no such veins in GTQT) %n%n3. Oil and gas veins: virtual veins composed of oil and natural gas divided into blocks, rather than visible oil wells. These oil and gas veins are virtual, and you don"t need to focus on them for now. %n%n4. Marble veins: giant spherical structures composed of black, red, and white marble, with minerals normally generated inside. Perhaps useful, but not really. %n%nAlmost every type of ore will have several variants, including stone-associated, netherrack-associated, end stone-associated, black granite-associated, red granite-associated, etc. However, in GTQT, there are no depleted ores, and ores mined from rocks of different materials are the same and stackable. This is done to save inventory space! %n%nThere are some differences between the variants of the same ore. The third byproduct of grinding this ore will be a powdered form of the associated rock of the processed ore. %n%nPart2: How to find veins§6§l(Important!!!)§r%n%n1. Check the igi prompt in the top left corner of your screen. When "Here is the vein center" appears, start mining down. (Note, the specific vein type is not provided) %n%n2. You can observe mineral powders scattered on the surface; what JEI shows corresponds to the type of vein. For example, if you see a small pile of redstone powder on the surface, there will be a redstone vein underground. %n%n3. You can use a prospecting instrument to obtain detailed information about the vein at a specific location. Detailed vein information can be queried in JEI, including its ore composition, location, structure, etc. How to get a prospecting instrument? You can buy one at the FTB Store! (See "Baby Early Education" for details) %n%nPart3: Good habits%n%nMark the veins you discover. The visionores mod will automatically mark the veins you found on your map. %n%nHere’s a portable component for you. Be careful, you won’t be able to charge it for a long time, so use it cautiously. %n%n§6§lAdd the original GregTech vein introduction (machine translation) at the end for reference. It may differ from the content of this integration pack. §r%n%nA vein attempts to generate for each 3*3 chunk randomly. %n%nSome details are repeated in the quest introductions, but if you want to know all the details, we think we need to explain further! §r%nVeins and their details can be found in §2JEI§r. They contain up to four different ores. %n§dSurface rocks§r indicate the type of vein beneath. In §2JEI§r, press U on the tiny dust you mined from the rocks, then navigate to the §aOre page§r. This page contains details about the ore generation type, generation mode, generation size and Y-level range, and spawn weight, i.e., the chance of generation. %nVeins are generated in a §4Grid§r. Each vein is spaced 3 blocks apart in the basic direction. %nThey are generated at the §4center§r of the block, where both the X and Z coordinates are multiples of §b1 plus 3§r (-8, -5, -2, 1, 4, 7…). %nIt’s simpler if you just rely on the §2game information§r displayed in the top left corner. In most cases, there will be a §dsurface rock§r at the center of the block, which provides completely accurate information about the vein. %nHowever, veins may be deleted by caves, oil deposits, or veins trying to generate on the ground. %nIt"s a good practice to mark the §dWaypoints§r to every vein you find and note their types. You might want to revisit them a few times. %nEach vein is always §d7 blocks§r high, and ores are produced in 4 different modes: %n-§9Top ores§r are produced in the higher 4 layers of the vein. %n-§9Bottom ores§r are produced in the lower 3 layers of the vein. %n-Ores§r between the §9are produced in the middle 3 layers of the vein. %n-§9Scattered ores§r are produced anywhere in the vein. This ore has the lowest content in the vein. %nThe same ore type can have two different generation modes, such as in tin ore veins. %n§%nIn the §6LV§r era, you can craft an ore explorer to help yourself find ores.

gtqt.quest.db.63.desc=Usually contains copper. %n%nJust kidding, for the convenience of beginners, here is a list of all early-game iron sources: %n%nChalcopyrite veins, yielding copper and iron; %nMagnetite veins, yielding vanadium, iron, and a small amount of gold; %nBrown limonite veins, which contain the most iron, with traces of copper from malachite inside; %nGranite placer veins, often overlooked but also a good source of iron, and the gypsum will later be used for blast furnaces. %n%nMoreover, you might wonder about the uses of many ores I haven’t mentioned. Well, if you’re a super electrolysis enthusiast, you can electrolyze most of the strange ores during the mid-voltage stage. But for minerals like zeolite and glauconite, my advice is to avoid mining them.

The flowers of the cactus are usually large, brightly colored, and bowl-shaped. Both the flowering and fruiting periods of the cactus are long, lasting for several months. The fruit of the cactus is usually a berry, although some species produce capsules. Cacti are distributed in arid regions, with some species also growing in tropical areas. %n%nCacti have diverse uses. Certain species can be cultivated as ornamental plants in gardens or pots. Some types of cacti are used to make beverages or food items, such as cactus fruit and cactus tea.

gtqt.quest.db.73.title=Please Start Your Performance
gtqt.quest.db.73.desc=The piston cylinder is a commonly used mechanical component, widely applied in various equipment and mechanical systems. Its working principle is primarily based on the two fundamental concepts of pressure transmission and energy conversion.%n%nThe cylinder is a cylindrical metal component that guides the piston to perform linear reciprocating motion within the cylinder. When liquid or gas enters the cylinder through the intake port of the piston cylinder, the piston is subjected to a forward thrust due to the pressure of the liquid or gas. When this thrust is sufficiently large, the piston begins to move forward. Simultaneously, the sealing ring on the cylinder wall ensures that the liquid or gas inside and outside the cylinder do not mix.%n%nIn engines, the cylinder plays a crucial role. In the engine cylinder, air converts thermal energy into mechanical energy through expansion, thereby driving the piston to perform reciprocating motion, which in turn drives the crankshaft to rotate, ultimately outputting power. In compressors, gases are compressed by the piston to increase pressure, thereby achieving the function of compression.%n%nThere are various types of piston cylinders, including single-acting cylinders and double-acting cylinders. Their structures also have unique characteristics, but they generally consist of a cylinder body, piston, sealing ring, etc. With the continuous advancement of technology, the performance of piston cylinders is also constantly improving, and their application fields are expanding, such as in printing, semiconductors, automation control, robotics, etc.%n%nIn summary, the piston cylinder is an important mechanical component whose working principle is based on pressure transmission and energy conversion, widely used in various equipment and mechanical systems.%n%nDone? I'll give you four, don't worry, you still have many, many more to do.

gtqt.quest.db.76.desc=We don't really recommend you to make a Tinker's bow, but we still kept this quest. %n%n---------%n%nAppendix: 《Craftsman's Manual - How to Make a Powerful Bow》%n%nCraftsman's Manual - How to Make a Powerful Bow%n%nA bow is an ancient and sophisticated weapon that has witnessed many major events and wars in human history. In many cultures, the bow is an important symbol that represents strength, speed and accuracy. So, how to make a powerful bow? Let's explore this question below together. %n%n1. Choose the right materials %n%nThere are many kinds of materials for making bows and arrows, such as wood, bamboo, composite materials, etc. Among them, wood is one of the most commonly used materials because it has the advantages of high strength, good stability and easy availability. When choosing wood, select woods that are hard in texture, clear in grain and free of cracks, such as oak, maple, etc. At the same time, pay attention to choosing the right length and diameter to make a proper bow body. %n%n2. Prepare tools and accessories %n%nMaking bows and arrows requires some professional tools and accessories, such as bow saws, bow planes, bow stones, bowstring cutters, bowstring sanders, etc. In addition, some accessories are also needed, such as glue, hemp rope, paint, etc. When preparing tools and accessories, make selections and preparations according to specific needs in making. %n%n3. Design the bow body%n%nDesigning the bow body is one of the key steps in making a bow and arrow. When designing the bow body, take into account factors such as length, diameter, elasticity and stability of the bow body. At the same time, also consider the purpose and use environment of the bow and arrow in order to make a more suitable bow body. In design, professional design software can be used for simulation and calculation in order to more accurately design the shape and size of the bow body. %n%n4. Make the bow body %n%nMaking the bow body is one of the core steps in making a bow and arrow. When making the bow body, first process and treat the wood to obtain suitable shape and size. Then use bow saws and bow planes to process and treat the wood to obtain a smoother and flatter surface. Finally, use bow stones to sand and polish the bow body for a smoother and better-looking surface. %n%n5. Make the bowstring %n%nMaking the bowstring is another core step in making a bow and arrow. When making the bowstring, choose proper materials and length to obtain suitable elasticity and tension. Usually, the bowstring can be made from hemp rope or synthetic materials. In making, bowstring cutter and bowstring sander can be used to cut and sand the bowstring for a smoother and flatter surface. %n%n6. Assemble and tune %n%nAfter completing the making of bow body and bowstring, assembly and tuning can be done. In assembly, pay attention to properly connect bow body and bowstring together, and use professional tools for fastening and adjustment. In tuning, adjust and test the bow and arrow to obtain optimum performance and accuracy. %n%n7. Summary and suggestions %n%nMaking a powerful bow requires careful design and making, as well as constant tuning and improvements. In the making process, pay attention to safe operation and use professional tools and materials to avoid accidental injuries or impacts on bow performance and quality. At the same time, also pay attention to protect environment and resources, and try to use renewable and eco-friendly materials and tools as much as possible. Finally, we hope the content this article can help you understand how to make a powerful bow, and we also hope you can utilize your imagination and creativity to make more ingenious and practical bows. %n%n

I will automatically open and close according to people's needs to provide the greatest convenience.%n%nHowever, in certain special situations, such as someone trying to enter a restricted area through me or forcibly pushing me open when I have to close, I may take some measures to protect myself and the safety of the building's interior. This might include squeezing the head of the person trying to enter.%n%nBut please note that my original design intention is not to squeeze people's heads. On the contrary, I am here to provide assistance when people need it, not to cause harm. Therefore, if someone encounters me squeezing their head, it is usually an accident, not my intention.%n%nMoreover, for those with mobility difficulties or who need to enter and exit frequently, the existence of automatic doors provides great convenience. I can automatically open and close according to their needs, helping them to smoothly enter and leave the building.%n%nIn summary, as an automatic door, my main task is to provide convenience and ensure safety.

You will use steam as an energy source, smelt steel, and open the door to electricity.%n%nWhen using pipes to transport water and output steam, you will find that these two liquids easily mix together, or steam occupies your water supply pipes!%n%nSolutions%n1: Set the pipe flow direction%n2: Ensure water supply%n3: Borrow an EIO conduit (or something else)%n§a4: The most useful method! Understand the mechanics. Greg's boiler outputs steam from the sides and top, but not from the bottom. Take advantage of this feature and only input water from the bottom to avoid cross-contamination in the pipes.§r%n%nRemember, if you are new to Greg, make sure your boiler doesn't run dry. Just like humans, boilers will explode when overheated.
gtqt.quest.db.98.title=It's better to destroy ten temples than to break up a marriage.
gtqt.quest.db.98.desc=This story tells us the importance of the alloy smelter.%n%nThe steam alloy smelter is the most energy-consuming among all steam single-block machines. Therefore, you will find that it cannot operate continuously with just one steam boiler. Solutions include building a steam buffer, increasing the number of boilers, or simply being patient and waiting.%n%nNow you have unlocked the recipe for crafting 4 bronze from 3 copper and 1 tin, as it should be! Additionally, non-handcraftable alloys like red alloy can also be produced now.%n%n----------------------------------%n%n§6If this is your first steam machine, here are some reminders!§r%n%n1. Steam machines require using a wrench to right-click on the machine to set the exhaust port, otherwise, the machine will only work once.%n2. Regarding the IO faces of the machine, the front face of the machine cannot perform IO operations, including conduits, interface panels, and the machine's own output.%n3. When connecting pipes to the machine, pay attention to the pipe's flow rate and temperature to avoid getting burned.%n%nEarly machines have a steam capacity of only 16,000 liters (mB), equivalent to 8,000 EU in steam machines.%n%nThis machine can only handle recipes with a power consumption of no more than 32 EU/t (ULV tier) and cannot be overclocked.%nSpecifically, in terms of recipe calculation, the time is doubled, and the power is halved (1 EU = 2 liters of steam).%nAdditionally, the machine will start running only when it has enough steam to complete the current recipe once.

gtqt.quest.db.101.desc=Your steam machines need pistons.%n%nIn previous versions, making pistons required a compressor, and making a compressor required pistons, leading to ten or even nine GT employees venturing into dungeons to find pistons. I hope this issue has been resolved by now.
gtqt.quest.db.102.title=Trash Mortar, Not as Good as My Crusher
gtqt.quest.db.102.desc=The mortar can only handle a small amount of crushing recipes. If you want to obtain some glass or wish to crush some minerals for increased yield, then you need a crusher to assist you!%n%nThis machine is called the Steam Grinder, but for some reason everyone likes to call it the crusher. Its working power is low, and at the same time its speed is very slow (which is why people usually directly make its upgraded version, the Large Steam Grinder).%n%nIt can achieve double yield after crushing raw ores! At the same time, it can also achieve the magical transformation of 1 Clay Ball → 1 Clay Powder...%n%n---------%n%nAppendix: 《Crusher Tongue Twister》%n%nIf you use the crusher to crush the crusher, will the crusher be crushed by the crusher?%nFirst, you should clarify whether the crusher being crushed will be crushed by the crusher that crushes the crusher, or if the crusher that crushes the crusher will be crushed by the crusher being crushed when crushing the crusher?%nThis depends on whether the crusher that crushes the crusher or the crusher being crushed is harder. If the crusher that crushes the crusher is harder than the crusher being crushed, then the crusher being crushed will be crushed by the crusher that crushes the crusher.%nIf the crusher being crushed is harder than the crusher that crushes the crusher, then the crusher that crushes the crusher will be crushed by the crusher being crushed when crushing the crusher. However, whether the crusher being crushed is crushed by the crusher that crushes the crusher, or the crusher that crushes the crusher is crushed by the crusher being crushed when crushing the crusher, it will cause irreversible damage to the crusher that crushes the crusher or the crusher being crushed.%nTherefore, please do not use the crusher that crushes the crusher to crush the crusher being crushed!%n

gtqt.quest.db.112.desc=Plant some rubber trees and collect some resin to prepare for making rubber.%n%nAppended:《I am the Super Invincible Rubber Tree》%n%nChapter 1: The Mysterious Planet%n%nIn the distant future, humanity has embarked on a journey to explore the universe. During an expedition to an unknown planet, a team of explorers accidentally discovered a peculiar plant——the rubber tree.%n%nThe environment of this planet is extremely harsh, with low temperatures, low pressure, and gravity only one-fifth that of Earth. However, this rubber tree is able to survive and thrive in such conditions.%n%nThe scientists in the expedition team became deeply interested in this plant and decided to conduct in-depth research on its growth habits and characteristics.%n%nChapter 2: The Secret of the Rubber Tree%n%nThe scientists discovered that this rubber tree grows at an astonishing rate, and its fruits contain a special substance with exceptional elasticity and wear resistance.%n%nThe scientists began studying the properties and uses of this substance, finding that it could be used to manufacture various high-performance materials such as bulletproof vests, running shoes, tires, and more.%n%nThis discovery excited the scientists, and they started researching how to bring this substance back to Earth for further study and development.%n%nChapter 3: Perilous Situations%n%nHowever, the planet's environment is extremely hostile, and the expedition team faced numerous dangers. They had to endure low temperatures, low pressure, and low gravity, while also dealing with unknown creatures and natural disasters.%n%nSome members of the team began experiencing physical discomfort, and some even died. The scientists started suspecting whether this rubber tree carried some kind of virus or bacteria that could harm humans.%n%nChapter 4: The Truth Revealed%n%nAfter a series of studies and investigations, the scientists finally uncovered the truth. It turned out that the rubber tree did not carry any virus or bacteria, but instead emitted a special energy field. This energy field was generated by a unique energy source within the rubber tree, which could affect the surrounding environment and living beings.%n%nWhen humans approached the rubber tree, they could feel the presence of this energy field. It not only made them feel comfortable and relaxed but also enhanced their intelligence and creativity. The members of the expedition team experienced physical discomfort and death precisely because they were affected by this energy field.%n%nChapter 5: New Hope%n%nDespite the planet's harsh environment, the scientists did not give up the opportunity to study the rubber tree. They began researching how to harness this energy field to improve human life and work conditions.%n%nAfter a series of experiments and studies, the scientists discovered that this energy field could be collected and stored in a special device. When humans needed to boost their intelligence and creativity, they only needed to activate and wear this device to feel the effects of the energy field.%n%nThe scientists also found that this energy field could not only enhance intelligence and creativity but also improve the quality of human life. For example, when people were under stress, the energy field could help them relax and relieve pressure; when people needed to improve focus and memory, the energy field could help them concentrate better and increase efficiency.%n%nChapter 6: Hope for the Future%n%nThe scientists' research findings gained widespread recognition and application. They brought this energy field technology back to Earth and began applying it in various fields.%n%nIn the days to come, humanity will use this energy field technology to improve their lives and work conditions, enhance their intelligence and creativity. At the same time, they will continue to explore the mysteries of the universe, searching for more unique plants and resources.

gtqt.quest.db.115.title=(Chapter Graduation Line) Finally, We Can Play with Electricity
gtqt.quest.db.115.desc=Did you ever play with those old electrical circuit puzzle toys when you were a kid? I loved playing with them as a child, and the voltage of those children's electrical components was roughly at the LV level.%n%nNow, you have the chance to relive your childhood. A 32V voltage is safe for you, but still powerful enough to accomplish many things.%n%nSteam turbines generate electricity by consuming steam and are divided into LV ~ IV grade machines. The maximum fluid storage capacities of the basic steam turbine, advanced steam turbine, and turbo steam turbine are 16,000L, 32,000L, and 64,000L respectively, with other grades following suit.%n%nConsuming 640L of steam in a steam turbine can generate 320EU of energy, while producing 4L of distilled water (only large steam turbines will return it; small machines won't).%n%nHere's a special reminder: all electrical machines must be protected from rain, otherwise it's boom！！！！！！！ (Not just the top of the machine, but also the blocks around it.

gtqt.quest.db.118.title=Electricity is Here
gtqt.quest.db.118.desc=Wire Tutorial！！！！！！Must-read, What kind of wire should I use?%n%nExcerpt from an old tutorial:%n%nEvery wire has its own properties, including maximum supported voltage, current, and wire resistance. First, let's understand energy. For the power unit P=UI, GT is the same, the voltage required by GT machines (for example 32) actually requires P=32w. That is to say, for a JEI recipe displaying 120EU, you can completely use the 32*4 method, which is 4 generators of 32EU level.%n%nOf course, for LV level generators, the output current is 1A. It can be understood that the electric power of an LV generator is 32W. In other words, some generators may have an output current of 2, 4....A. The electric power at this time is still calculated according to P=UI.%n%nSecond, let's take a look at wires. Here we define wire X, voltage 32, current 4, line loss 2, which means that this wire can support a maximum voltage of 32V and a maximum current of 4A, that is, the maximum power transmitted by this wire is P=128W.%n%nThird, the loss of the wire is called line loss, with the unit V/(m·A). Still taking wire X as an example, its line loss is 2 volts/(meter·ampere). For a 4-block cable connected from a 32EU level generator (1A), the voltage at the end is only 24EU/t. At this point, machines requiring recipes above 24EU will not work.%n%nFor generators with an output current of 2A, the formula W=UI still applies.

gtqt.quest.db.121.title=Resistance
gtqt.quest.db.121.desc=The roles of resistors in integrated circuits mainly include the following aspects:%n%nCurrent Limiting Role: In integrated circuits, resistors are often used to limit the current magnitude, in order to protect other components in the circuit from damage caused by excessive current.%nCurrent Shunting Role: When current passes through a resistor, a voltage drop occurs across the resistor. Hence, a portion of the current can be shunted through the resistor to alleviate the load on the main circuit.%nVoltage Dropping Role: In situations where a high voltage needs to be converted to a low voltage, resistors can serve a voltage dropping function. By connecting resistors in series within the circuit, the high voltage can be divided to obtain a lower voltage.%nVoltage Dividing Role: When there is a need to split a higher voltage into multiple lower voltages, multiple resistors can be connected in parallel within the circuit to achieve a voltage dividing effect.%nBiasing Role: In circuits such as amplifiers, resistors can be used to set the biasing point of the circuit, thereby adjusting the operating state of the circuit.

It turned out that I was transported to the other world for some reason, and this reason was closely related to my destiny.%n%nChapter 13: A New Mission%n%nAfter uncovering the secrets of the other world, I realized that I was entrusted with a new mission. I need to use my power and wisdom to protect the peace and prosperity of both the real world and the other world.%n%nSo, I returned to the real world and continued to develop my career. At the same time, I actively participated in public welfare to contribute to society. Furthermore, I used my influence to call on more people to pay attention to social issues and actively participate in solving them.

gtqt.quest.db.147.desc=Does reading 'Yongle Encyclopedia' bring eternal happiness?%n%nThe 'Yongle Encyclopedia' is a treasure of Chinese culture, encompassing the crystallization of wisdom from thousands of years of the Chinese nation, a monumental scholarly work. However, it cannot directly bring eternal happiness to a person.%n%nHappiness is a personal and subjective feeling, influenced by various factors, including one's psychological state, living environment, interpersonal relationships, etc. While the 'Yongle Encyclopedia' contains many thoughts and insights on life, morality, philosophy, and other aspects, it does not directly change a person's psychological state or living environment, and thus cannot directly bring eternal happiness.%n%nCertainly, some of the ideas and viewpoints in the 'Yongle Encyclopedia' can inspire people to ponder the meaning of life and society, helping them better face the challenges and difficulties of life. At the same time, reading the 'Yongle Encyclopedia' can also enhance people's cultural literacy and aesthetic abilities, allowing them to appreciate and understand the profundity and breadth of Chinese culture more deeply.%n%nTherefore, while the 'Yongle Encyclopedia' cannot directly bring eternal happiness, it can inspire people to contemplate the meaning of life and society, enhance their cultural literacy and aesthetic abilities, and bring more thoughts and enlightenment to their lives.

Person A, bearing a grudge, hired a thug online to rape her roommate, Person B.%nWhen the thug made his move in the dark, because Person B wasn't in the dorm, he mistook Person A for Person B and raped her.%nThe whole thing was that Person A paid to have herself raped. If Person A were to report it, it would count as her turning herself in.%nThe thug is guilty—there's no debate about that. The question is, did Person A do anything wrong?%nProfessor Luo explains: According to the legal conformity theory, the rape was completed—meaning Person A raped herself.%n2.%nA man tried to rape a woman, but she kicked him into a cesspit and drowned him?%nA woman, a female cadre.

It is worth noting that all electrical appliances should be careful about voltage and getting wet in the rain. %nBuild a roof for your base. Otherwise, it will explode if you get too close. %n%nEU is packed into individual energy packets and transmitted from power supply machines to electrical machines through wires. Power supply machines are often called generators, while electrical machines are generally simply referred to as machines. The size of the energy packet is called voltage (V), and the number of energy packets is called current (A). %n%nGregTech divides voltage into sixteen levels, which are sometimes also used to describe the stage the player is in. For historical reasons, the concept of voltage level used is somewhat special, with LV as level 1. If the voltage output from the power supply machine exceeds the maximum voltage of the electrical machine, the machine will immediately explode. %n%nAll machines have their maximum input (output) voltage and current. The maximum voltage can be seen on the tooltip of small machines, while the maximum voltage of large machines is determined by the voltage level of their energy cells/power cells. Generators indicate output voltage, electrical machines indicate rated input voltage, and transformers indicate both input and output voltage. If the voltage you send exceeds the maximum voltage the machine can accept, the machine will immediately explode!

gtqt.quest.db.201.title=Power Generation Guide
gtqt.quest.db.201.desc=This is a power generation guide written for GT newbies. This guide is only for reference based on experience and may not be fully applicable to GTQT, so please refer to it at your discretion. %n%nHow should power generation be handled at each stage? Generally speaking, just remember that the principle of power generation is §6\"The best power generation is the one that goes unnoticed\"§r. If you constantly worry about power supply for your base, it means you haven't done a good job on power infrastructure. A well-designed power system doesn't require much management. For example, when using steam power, if your steam production is significantly lower than your power demand, you'll often have to stop and wait for steam, which is a waste of time. %n%nThere are usually two methods to help optimize your power generation: %n1、§6Increase power generation.§r Straightforward, but note that simply adding more generators doesn't count as \"increasing power generation\". Strictly speaking, it refers to the improvement of fuel production capacity. Taking steam as an example, building more boilers is increasing power generation. %n2、§6Balance peak and off-peak power usage.§r Your machines won't all be running 24/7 (…right?), so there will be peaks and troughs in power demand. §aEnergy storage facilities§r can help deliver power when you need it and store more when you don't. Typical energy storage facilities are divided into EU storage and fuel storage, with fuel storage being particularly advantageous in the early stages. For instance, an LV structural tank can store 4000 buckets of steam, containing far more potential EU than a regular battery box. GT veterans know that this involves the concept of §afuel density§r: Clearly, storing a drum of high-cetane fuel is much better than storing a drum of steam, as we say high-cetane fuel has a much higher fuel density than steam. Although high-density fuels are harder to make, they are generally worth it. %n%nAdditionally, although there is no obvious difference, veterans might mention free-loading and non-free-loading power generation. Free-loading power generation generally refers to types that don't require you to "add fuel

gtqt.quest.db.209.desc=I'm envious. It's really strong, acid-resistant, and supports non-integer fluids!%n%nActually, you can craft it at LV already, but I don't think you'll make an LV press mold just for some pipes.
gtqt.quest.db.210.title=Molecular Disassembly Engineering
gtqt.quest.db.210.desc=I don't need to say anything for you to understand the importance (and fantasy) of this machine. It will definitely die of overwork before you, who stay up late playing GT.%n%nIn the medium-voltage stage, most powders can be decomposed by it into basic components. You need to pay special attention to the production of aluminum powder, silicon powder, and chromium powder, as they can basically only be obtained through electrolysis machines. You can also obtain a lot of oxygen by electrolyzing mineral powders.%n%nHighly recommended for electrolysis:%n%nRuby: The best source of chromium.%nClay: Once you find a clay mountain biome, it becomes the optimal source of aluminum and silicon. It also byproducts many alkali metals.%nPhosphate: Produces phosphorus, used for LV superconductors.%nBorax: The only source of boron.
gtqt.quest.db.211.title=Auntie Presses Down
gtqt.quest.db.211.desc=I believe you've been waiting for this for a long time. Finally! The general production scheme for most components has now been unlocked by you. It's like a weapon master that can perform different tasks by attaching various heads.

gtqt.quest.db.212.desc=I don't know (guilty)%n%nThis gay guy is one of the few you have to deal with at every voltage level, and his presence in mv is only stronger, not weaker. You have unlocked a series of new alloys, including the ones you need for the next stage.
gtqt.quest.db.213.title=Medium-voltage Coil
gtqt.quest.db.213.desc=You can't make an energy storage just yet. But it has its special uses.
gtqt.quest.db.214.title=The Not So Expensive Episode
gtqt.quest.db.214.desc=Since you have already established a relatively complete low-pressure machinery system, this expensive machine doesn't seem as costly anymore. I can't help but wonder, if I were richer, would it be easier for me to find a partner?%n%nThe assembly machine of the medium-pressure stage has unlocked many new recipes.
gtqt.quest.db.215.title=Faster, Higher, Stronger
gtqt.quest.db.215.desc=At the medium-pressure stage, simple chemical reactions can no longer satisfy Steve's needs.

It's an enhanced version of this little guy.
gtqt.quest.db.216.title=Ode to Steel，dlc
gtqt.quest.db.216.desc=A new type of steel alloyed with chromium and vanadium. In MV, it's required to synthesize the main block of the fluid drill, as well as the saw blades for the cutter.%n%nVanadium steel is alloy steel where vanadium is the primary alloying element or plays a significant role. The effects of vanadium in steel include enhancing hardenability and carbide formation, withstanding high temperatures, having a strong secondary hardening effect, and significantly improving hardness. It can refine grain size and stabilize the microstructure. It is extensively used in alloy tool steels.%n%nVanadium microalloyed high-strength low-alloy steel is currently the largest application field of vanadium in steel, and its application level is an indicator of the development level of steel product structure in a country/region.
gtqt.quest.db.217.title=Unsustainable Development
gtqt.quest.db.217.desc=So what? Do you know this game is called \"Minecraft\"? I can drill as much as I want.%n%nThis is one of the few machines that don't require a maintenance chamber, and it can help you drill a massive amount of fluids (actually not that massive?).%n%nSince the MV energy chamber will take some time to make, you now need dual chamber boosting to use it. It extracts from virtual oil fields rather than physical ones, and you'll need to use your prospector to prospect the oil fields. Note that the basic model will rapidly deplete the virtual oil field's reserves.%n%nAs a bonus, it gives you something nice to send the drilled fluids back home remotely.
gtqt.quest.db.218.title=Welding of an Egyptian Pharaoh or Princess
gtqt.quest.db.218.desc=Around 200 BC, ancient Egypt, Rome, and Babylon used borax to make glass and weld gold. The French chemist Gay-Lussac obtained elemental boron by reducing boric acid with potassium metal. The content of boron in the earth's crust is 0.001%%. Boron is a black or silvery-gray solid. Crystalline boron is black, with a hardness second only to diamond, and is relatively brittle. %n%nYou don’t need such a complicated preparation method, just electrolyze it from borax.
gtqt.quest.db.219.title=Increase Production, Right Now
gtqt.quest.db.219.desc=You might make this one for boron, and it's also very cheap.
gtqt.quest.db.220.title=Primitive Resource Acquisition
gtqt.quest.db.220.desc=The Beginning of Everything. %n%n If you spawn in a plain, forest, or biome with trees nearby, gather some wood to start your early development. %n%n Additionally, gravel can only be found near rivers, lakes, and coastlines, and you’ll need a lot of it in the early stages. %n%n The modpack uses a modified RTG terrain generator that adds hundreds of biomes while maintaining exploration performance. The terrain is perfectly generated according to the RTG system, but this also means some resources are harder to obtain due to the terrain variations. Therefore, you’ll need to explore the map extensively to ensure your progression.

gtqt.quest.db.223.title=MCer, You Should Be Confident
gtqt.quest.db.223.desc=Even at the mv stage you already need polytetrafluoroethylene, and I'll teach you how to do it.%n%nFirst, we need to make chloroform. Its name itself is a mistake, stemming from the fact that early human chemists weren't bright enough. However, our translation still perpetuates this error.%n%nI hope you have enough chlorine!
gtqt.quest.db.224.title=Hydrochloric Acid Overflow
gtqt.quest.db.224.desc=Next, under the catalysis of copper chloride, tetrafluoroethylene is produced.%n%nThese steps will all generate a large amount of hydrochloric acid. Consider electrolyzing to recover chlorine, or filling the production line with more chlorine.
gtqt.quest.db.225.title=Looks are Everything
gtqt.quest.db.225.desc=Pretty optical fibers that look very scientific. Now you know what our modpack focuses on - it's actually focused on looking good. %n%n It requires some glass wires pressed from borosilicate glass strips.
gtqt.quest.db.226.title=Chemistry Revival Contest
gtqt.quest.db.226.desc=What are you using for this? I guess it's ice!... Crystal. %n%nUnbelievable, elemental fluorine can be prepared in such a highly unscientific way. What would those dead chemists think? %n%nHowever, the elemental version is not very useful, you need that famous acid that corrodes glass. In a real laboratory, Moissan discovered fluorine through the opposite process: electrolysis of hydrofluoric acid solution. Lao Mo, I miss you.;;;
gtqt.quest.db.227.title=Tears of the Era
gtqt.quest.db.227.desc=It is said that Japan has recently completely phased out the use of floppy disks. Laughable, their civil servants are still using fax machines.%n%nHowever, this actually cannot be fully called a floppy disk, as it is not the same thing as OC's floppy disks. The production cost is also significantly more expensive.

It can provide you with invaluable computing resources. The mechanism is actually not that complicated. Basically, the more modules you install, the higher the power consumption and heat generation, requiring better coolant, and so on. In GTQT, mv stage, you already need to build a server room to obtain computing power, but this machine alone is useless. It is one of the four major components of the mv main line.%n%nHere's some empirical data: All level one modules, two of each installed (i.e., leaving six empty slots, filled with empty ones), will consume 120eu/t while providing 8CWU/t computing power. This way, you can drive this power-hungry beast with an lv power hatch.%n%nSee the jei description for details.

It seems so, meow.
gtqt.quest.db.231.title=Export Your Computing Power
gtqt.quest.db.231.desc=Use this! Don’t do the lv one. After you have the mv energy tank later, the computing power output will be more than 8.
gtqt.quest.db.232.title=Composition of Plastic Bags
gtqt.quest.db.232.desc=The usage rate of polyvinyl chloride is lower than polyethylene both in reality and in games, but it is still widely used.

gtqt.quest.db.236.title=No More Choking
gtqt.quest.db.236.desc=At least that's the case in the game. You still need to put in some effort for your chip...%n%nPhotolithography is the most complex and critical process step in semiconductor chip production, with long lead times and high costs. The challenge and the key point of semiconductor chip production lies in how to create the desired circuit pattern on a silicon wafer, a process achieved through photolithography. The level of photolithography directly determines the process and performance level of the chip.%n%nSo, folks, this machine is too complicated to use! It requires computing power and special photoresist. And it's very expensive. I suggest your shell block be made of aluminum, so you won't need to replace the shell block when you upgrade to HV.%n%nIt is one of the four major components. Remember, computing power input requires a special chamber.
gtqt.quest.db.237.title=Not a Russian Stove
gtqt.quest.db.237.desc=The Czochralski process, also known as the Czochralski method, is a crystal growth technique used to obtain single crystal materials such as semiconductors (e.g., silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide), metals (e.g., palladium, platinum, silver, gold), salts, and synthetic gemstones. This method is named after the Polish scientist Jan Czochralski, who invented it in 1916 while studying the crystallization rates of metals. Later, it evolved into one of the standard processes in steel plants. %n%nThe most important application of the Czochralski method is the growth of ingots, boules, and single-crystal silicon. Other semiconductors, such as gallium arsenide, can also be grown using the Czochralski method, and there are other methods (such as the Bridgman-Stockbarger method) that can achieve lower crystal defect densities. %n%nOne of the five major components. Who would have thought it was invented by the Poles! By the way, you’ll also need a tiny bit of quartzite as the main block.

gtqt.quest.db.243.title=Silicon Processing Line
gtqt.quest.db.243.desc=Do you miss the simple silicon processing of original GT and the old version of QT? Now, the classic silicon processing is no longer so convenient and requires an MV chemical reactor.%n%nI don't care how you got so much silicon, but to make solar-grade silicon usable for wafers, you first need to turn silicon into trichlorosilane.

gtqt.quest.db.293.title=Lead
gtqt.quest.db.293.desc=Lead is a very cheap metal in GregTech, with low demand and ample supply. It is an excellent material for pipes, especially when made into crude bronze.
gtqt.quest.db.294.title=Silver
gtqt.quest.db.294.desc=Silver is a relatively rare metal, and it is not very common in the interlaced world either.%n%nIn the steam age, it was mainly used to make solar boilers, but solar boilers are not very powerful anymore.
gtqt.quest.db.295.title=Nickel
gtqt.quest.db.295.desc=Nickel can be obtained from nickel veins in the main world.%n%nIt is primarily used as an alloy.
gtqt.quest.db.296.title=Raw Bronze
gtqt.quest.db.296.desc=Raw bronze is the type of copper alloy with the highest lead content. The advantage of raw bronze is that it is easy to process and can be made into complex shapes and small parts, making it widely used in the production of bearings, gears, hinges, and other mechanical parts that require precision processing.%n%nHowever, the drawback of leaded bronze is that it has low strength and is not wear-resistant. Compared to other copper alloys, it has a relatively short service life.%n%nYou can use it to make some parts of large steam machines.
gtqt.quest.db.297.title=Invar
gtqt.quest.db.297.desc=Unlike crude bronze, Invar is made using an alloy furnace.%n%nYou can now use it to build some of those big steam machines!%n%nInvar is a nickel-iron alloy composed of 36%% nickel, 63.8%% iron, and 0.2%% carbon. Due to its extremely low thermal expansion coefficient, Invar can maintain a fixed length over a wide temperature range, making it suitable for manufacturing parts with strict temperature deformation requirements, such as thermometers, gauge blocks, measuring scales, and microwave equipment. Furthermore, Invar is also used in the shadow masks of displays, the low-expansion layer of bimetallic thermal elements, sealing materials for electronic components, precision instrument and meter parts, special transmission cables, and improving the stability of ion lasers.%n%nOther characteristics of Invar include low strength and hardness, low thermal conductivity, and high plasticity and toughness, making it an excellent ultra-low-temperature resistant material with a typical operating temperature range of -250℃ to +200℃. However, it does have one drawback—it's prone to rusting.%n%nThe discovery of Invar has made significant contributions to scientific progress. Its discoverer, Swiss physicist Charles Édouard Guillaume, was awarded the 1920 Nobel Prize in Physics for this achievement, making him the first and only scientist to receive this prestigious honor for a metallurgical accomplishment.

There, blizzards pounce on the lonely cells like vicious wolves, as if trying to devour everything. With cold and fear, I dragged my heavy steps onto this barren land.%n%nLife in the labor camp was like hell. Every day, we were forced to toil in the severe cold, the food as hard as stones, never filling our stomachs. The administrators were cold and ruthless, and punishment was a common occurrence. Yet, despite the harsh environment, I held onto a glimmer of hope—I had to survive.%n%nChapter Two: The Struggle Between Life and Death%n%nLife in Siberia was full of challenges and dangers. Sometimes, I would lose consciousness from exhaustion and cold, only to wake up in the infirmary covered by icy blankets. The doctor told me that had I been any later, I might have left this world forever. At that moment, I told myself I couldn't die here. I had to live, to prove to the world that I could make it.%n%nIn the labor camp, I met a man named Alexei. He was kind and wise, teaching me survival skills and how to cope with the cold and hunger. He gave me hope and courage, telling me that as long as we persevered, there was always a chance to escape this place.%n%nWith his help, I started to read and learn. I began to feel hope and confidence in life. I knew that as long as I didn't give up, I could find a way out.%n%nChapter Three: The Coming of the Storm%n%nHowever, life wasn't so easy. One day, a sudden blizzard swept through the entire labor camp. The wind cut like knives across my face, and I could barely stand.

The cells around me were continually buried under snow, as if about to entomb us all.%n%nIn the midst of this storm, I felt the fragility and helplessness of life. Yet, I knew I couldn't give up. I had to stand straight and face the storm. Only then could I survive.%n%nChapter Four: Seeing the Light Again%n%nWith relentless effort, I finally gained my freedom one day. As I walked out of the gates of the labor camp, the sun was bright, and the sky was a clear blue. I felt as if I had been reborn. I was grateful to Alexei and everyone who had helped me. I knew that without their support, I couldn't have achieved my freedom.%n%nNow, I have started a new chapter of my life.

gtqt.quest.db.309.desc=If you feel that your crops are growing too slowly, don't be stingy with your Hextech fertilizer. Just a little bit, and it can grow. %n%nAppendix: 《Feasibility Report on Bone Meal for Ripening Crops》%n%nFeasibility Report on Bone Meal for Ripening Crops%n%nI. Introduction%n%nAs a fertilizer, bone meal has certain application value in agricultural production. In recent years, with the continuous development of agricultural technology, research on using bone meal to ripen crops has gradually increased. This report aims to explore the feasibility of using bone meal to ripen crops, in order to provide new ideas and methods for agricultural production. %n%nII. Nutritional Components and Functions of Bone Meal%n%nBone meal contains rich nutritional components, such as nitrogen and calcium, which are essential elements for plant growth. In agricultural production, bone meal can be used as a fertilizer to provide the necessary nutrients for plants, promoting their growth and development. %n%nIII. Principles of Using Bone Meal to Ripen Crops%n%nThe principle of using bone meal to ripen crops mainly involves utilizing the nutritional components it contains to stimulate plant growth. When plants absorb sufficient nutrients, their growth rate accelerates, shortening the growth cycle and achieving the effect of ripening. Additionally, certain components in bone meal may have hormone-like effects on plants, further promoting their growth and development. %n%nIV. Feasibility Analysis of Using Bone Meal to Ripen Crops%n%nAdvantages: As a fertilizer, bone meal has the advantages of wide availability, moderate price, and long-lasting effects. Moreover, the rich nutritional components in bone meal can meet various elements required for plant growth, helping to promote their growth and development.%nDisadvantages: The nutrient content in bone meal is limited and cannot fully meet all the elements required for plant growth. Additionally, the fertilizer effect of bone meal is relatively slow, requiring a longer time to achieve the ripening effect. At the same time, excessive use of bone meal may pollute the soil and affect soil quality.%nApplicability: Bone meal is suitable for various crops, but the absorption and utilization efficiency of bone meal may vary among different crops. Therefore, when using bone meal to ripen crops, it is necessary to reasonably match and use it according to the type and growth stage of the crops.%nEconomic Benefits: Using bone meal to ripen crops can reduce production costs, increase yield and quality, thereby enhancing economic benefits. However, it should be noted that excessive use of bone meal may increase production costs and reduce economic benefits.%nEnvironmental Impact: Using bone meal to ripen crops has a relatively small impact on the environment, but excessive use may pollute the soil and water sources. Therefore, it is necessary to control the dosage and frequency of use when applying bone meal to avoid adverse environmental impacts.%nV. Conclusion and Recommendations%n%nThis report analyzed the feasibility of using bone meal to ripen crops and concluded that bone meal, as a fertilizer, has certain application value in agricultural production. However, it should be noted that the ripening effect of bone meal is limited and cannot completely replace the roles of other fertilizers and pesticides. Therefore, when using bone meal to ripen crops, the following points should be considered: %n%nMatch and use it reasonably according to the type and growth stage of the crops;%nControl the dosage and frequency of use to avoid adverse environmental impacts;%nCombine it with other fertilizers and pesticides reasonably to achieve better ripening effects.

gtqt.quest.db.381.title=Step One - Crude Gasoline
gtqt.quest.db.381.desc=Producing this kind of gasoline requires a large number of cracking units. Since the production route for high-octane gasoline hasn't been modified much, the experience of predecessors is also relatively abundant. %n%n Before starting the production, I would like to remind you that all light fuels should undergo §9 mild hydrogen cracking §r to obtain the maximum amount of octane. §6 Octane §r is the "bottleneck" material for high-octane gasoline and can only be obtained in this way. %n%n Due to what was mentioned above, our naphtha will overflow in large quantities, so the naphtha should also be cracked to obtain materials like toluene. You will basically want to crack every kind of oil. Maximizing the output theoretically requires knowledge of linear algebra, but for the needs of most employees, just go ahead and do it however. %n%n The first step is to produce crude gasoline. It is made from several relatively common chemical materials. This reaction must be carried out in a large chemical reactor.

gtqt.quest.db.390.title=Multi-block Liquid Tank
gtqt.quest.db.390.desc=Tanks are places where multiblock machines interact with fluids. There is a distinction between input tanks and output tanks, and tanks of different levels have varying capacities, with higher-level tanks being larger. Currently, a tank can only hold one type of fluid, and upgrading only increases the capacity for that single fluid. After reaching a certain stage, you can choose to make multiple tanks to hold several fluids.%n%nInput tanks are where you put things in or connect fluid pipes. The interface side of the input tank can automatically draw fluid from the container in the facing grid.%n%nOutput tanks are where multiblock machines output fluids after operation, and they can also be connected to fluid pipes.

I wonder if the administrator of that universe feels like the world is a bit laggy.%n%nAnyway, conveyor belts are great for pulling items out of machines in the early game. Although I guess you'll be using Ender IO conduits.%n%nRemember, in GregTech, cover plates like conveyor belts can also be right-clicked onto machines to transfer fluids from one place to another.%n%nSimilar things include robotic arms, electric pumps, etc., you can explore them yourself.%n
gtqt.quest.db.393.title=Part assembly... why is it still slower than handcrafting
gtqt.quest.db.393.desc=A component assembly machine is a mechanical device used to assemble different parts together. It typically includes one or more workbenches, along with a series of automated or semi-automated assembly tools and devices, which are used to assemble the parts in a predetermined sequence and manner.%n%nYou need it to manufacture electric pumps.

gtqt.quest.db.394.title=Where Did the Mechanical Arm Come From
gtqt.quest.db.394.desc=A driveshaft is a high-speed, minimally-supported rotating body that serves as the power-transmitting shaft within a universal joint driveshaft assembly. It is a critical component primarily responsible for transmitting engine power to the wheels, enabling vehicle propulsion. The driveshaft typically consists of a tubular shaft, a sliding sleeve, and universal joints. The sliding sleeve automatically adjusts to accommodate variations in distance between the transmission and the drive axle, while the universal joints connect different sections and transmit power. %n%nDriveshafts generally undergo dynamic balancing tests before leaving the factory to ensure smooth operation. In front-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles, the driveshaft's role is to transmit rotational motion from the transmission to the differential, thereby driving wheel rotation. Driveshafts can be multi-piece units, with sections connected via universal joints to adapt to various vehicle layouts and drivetrain requirements. %n%nDriveshafts are primarily classified into two types: rigid universal joint driveshafts and flexible universal joint driveshafts. Rigid universal joints transmit power through hinged connections of components, while flexible universal joints rely on elastic components for power transmission, offering cushioning and vibration dampening. Additionally, based on whether the driveshaft exhibits significant elasticity in the torsional direction, it can be categorized as either a rigid or flexible driveshaft. %n%nDriveshafts play a vital role in vehicles such as automobiles, with their performance directly impacting driving smoothness and power transmission efficiency. Therefore, the maintenance and upkeep of driveshafts are crucial to ensure their proper functioning and extend their service life. %n%nHang in there, something good is coming to save you from the hassle of working on these things manually.

gtqt.quest.db.395.desc=Pity you're not the king.%n%nBut this robotic arm can indeed perform complex automation, intelligently helping you move things around. So it's only natural that it's a bit more expensive.%n%nThe robotic arm is a complex system with high precision, multiple inputs and outputs, highly nonlinear, and strong coupling. It consists of motion elements, guiding devices, arms, and other components. Due to its unique operational flexibility, robotic arms have been widely used in industrial assembly, safety and explosion-proof fields, and other areas. The robotic arm system includes modular robotic arms and dexterous hands, and its dynamic equations have characteristics such as nonlinearity, strong coupling, and real-time variability.%n%nRobotic arms can be divided into multi-joint robotic arms, Cartesian coordinate robotic arms, spherical coordinate robotic arms, polar coordinate robotic arms, and cylindrical coordinate robotic arms based on their different structural forms. Among them, the Cartesian coordinate robotic arm has three main degrees of freedom, consisting of movements in the X, Y, and Z directions. By adding a rotating device at the execution terminal, it can reach any coordinate point in space.%n%nThe operational flexibility of robotic arms enables them to perform various complex tasks, such as precise positioning, grasping, moving, and assembling. Furthermore, with the continuous development of artificial intelligence and robotics, the intelligence level of robotic arms is also constantly improving. They can achieve functions such as autonomous navigation, object recognition, and path planning through sensors and control systems, further expanding their application fields.%n%nIn summary, robotic arms are an important component of robot systems. Their complexity and flexibility make them indispensable tools in various fields.

gtqt.quest.db.397.title=A Must for Civilized Grey People
gtqt.quest.db.397.desc=If you use this for your toilet at home, the suction power definitely won't be very strong. But it's just perfect for your Gray factory.%n%nElectric pumps, also known as electric water pumps, are widely used in various fields. They mainly consist of a pump body, motor, base, etc. The motor drives the pump body to rotate, thereby drawing out the liquid and delivering it to where it's needed. Electric pumps are characterized by their compact structure, ease of use, high efficiency, and low noise, so they are widely used in industry, agriculture, households, etc.%n%nThe working principle of electric pumps can be divided into two types: centrifugal and positive displacement. Centrifugal electric pumps utilize the centrifugal force generated by the high-speed rotation of the impeller to draw in the liquid from the inlet and fling it out, forming a continuous liquid flow. Positive displacement electric pumps, on the other hand, draw in and discharge the liquid by changing the internal volume of the pump body. Common positive displacement electric pumps include piston pumps and diaphragm pumps.%n%nElectric pumps have a very wide range of applications and can be used to transport various liquids, such as water, oil, acid and alkali solutions, etc. In the agricultural field, electric pumps are widely used in irrigation, drainage, etc. In the industrial field, electric pumps are used to transport various media, such as coolant, lubricating oil, cleaning liquid, etc. In the household field, electric pumps are often used in equipment such as water pumps and washing machines.%n%nOverall, the electric pump is a very practical mechanical device with broad application prospects and market demand. With the continuous advancement of technology and the ever-expanding application fields, the performance and efficiency of electric pumps will also be continuously improved and perfected.
gtqt.quest.db.398.title=Wash Wash Take a Bath
gtqt.quest.db.398.desc=Washing is a process that uses hydraulic or mechanical forces to scrub clay-cemented or muddy ores, breaking them down, washing off fine mud from the ore surface, and separating them. This process mainly consists of two operations: breaking and separating. The breaking operation primarily utilizes the flushing and soaking effects of water to expand and break down the clay, sometimes supplemented by mechanical impacts, stirring, and abrasion to accelerate the breaking process. The separating operation mainly categorizes clay and ore particles based on their different sizes, a process that can employ wet screening or hydraulic classification, or both simultaneously. %n%nThe primary purpose of washing is to remove impurities such as mud and sand from the ore, enhancing its quality to meet standard requirements. This is crucial in the mineral processing industry because the presence of impurities may affect the subsequent processing and utilization of the ore. For example, placer deposits of gold, platinum, tungsten, tin, and deeply oxidized and weathered lead, copper, iron, and manganese ores usually require washing before crushing or beneficiation to remove some gangue or clay. Additionally, washing is also used to process construction sands and ceramics raw materials. %n%nOverall, washing is an important mineral processing method that can effectively improve the quality and utilization value of ores. %n%nYou need the by-products of washing to obtain some metals that you currently cannot directly acquire.
gtqt.quest.db.399.title=Washing Machine
gtqt.quest.db.399.desc=During college, I shared a washing machine with the guys on my floor. We washed everything in it—socks, briefs, broken earphones, failed exam papers, leftover beer bottles, and tears from breakups. Later, when we graduated, we went to see the washing machine, and it was broken.%n%nOf course, do you think a washing machine could handle that much without breaking? Stop being so poetic and come check out our Gray Company's blender. It can blend all sorts of weirdly shaped alloys. You might want some battery alloys and solder, or something.%n%n%n
gtqt.quest.db.400.title=The Slightly Hot Separator
gtqt.quest.db.400.desc=Awesome, compared to a regular centrifuge, it can produce more and more interesting mineral byproducts, and the power consumption (compared to the previous version) is not too high either. It seems that thermodynamics indeed makes your production expand!%n%nOverall, the thermal centrifuge is a very important separation device, and it cannot be substituted with a regular centrifuge. You now need to use it to obtain some aluminum powder byproducts to make new alloys. I recommend using mica ore for centrifugation, as you will need a lot of mica later for building the blast furnace. Remember to crush and wash it first, for more details consult jei.
gtqt.quest.db.401.title=Nice to Meet You, Senpai
gtqt.quest.db.401.desc=Aluminum is a silvery-white light metal characterized by its low density, good electrical and thermal conductivity, strong ductility, and ease of processing. In nature, aluminum usually exists in a combined state and requires smelting processes to obtain pure aluminum. %n%nThis might not be your first encounter with aluminum, but it is definitely your first time meeting Greg's aluminum powder, because a certain level of technology is required to produce aluminum powder. %n%n§aGenerally, you first electrolyze various gem powders to obtain your first batch of aluminum powder. Once you can craft your first mv electrolyzer, you can change your aluminum source.§r %n%nNow we have discarded all the inexplicable aluminum processing routes from previous versions and remade the quest book.

Use the aluminum powder to make aluminum hydroxide powder. %n3. Industrial electrolyzer, electrolyze twice.
gtqt.quest.db.402.title=New Occultism: General Methodological Outline
gtqt.quest.db.402.desc=Having started from almost nothing, you know very little about modern mysticism, and the inheritance known as the Grimoire has given you much enlightenment. However, this book is full of various magical devices and strange inventions with little practical application, and for someone already accustomed to using machines for everything, much of the content in the Grimoire is already outdated. %n%n You deeply understand that scientific progress relies on the methodology of bold hypotheses and careful verification. Therefore, you believe that to validate the theory of volition, you must base it on your own theories, discard the superstitions and ambiguities in inherited teachings, and create a brand new mysticism. %n%n Firstly, magic is a sideline for you; your main focus is on the industrial production system in the base, so you believe the core concept of the new mysticism is §apragmatism§r. In your vision, science and magic are in a competitive relationship: whichever side can achieve the industrial results you desire more economically will be the winner. In this process, you do not need to sacrifice magic for industry, nor do you need to deliberately accommodate the hassles of ancient mysticism: you simply expect to solve problems in the most efficient way. %n%n Secondly, based on the theory of volition, you categorize things into §a“purely natural”§r and §9“volition-participated”§r. The former and the latter can transform into each other, and all phenomena achieved entirely based on the former are called scientific phenomena. Conversely, those relying on both the latter and the former are called magical phenomena by you. According to the theory, the reason why the world looks the way it does now is closely related to the mystics’ predecessors and ancient wizards you know. You boldly speculate that many creations that appear purely natural might not have existed thousands of years ago without the magical labor of wizards, so “volition-participated” things may be much more common than you think. The greatest significance of this hypothesis itself lies in explaining why some mystical materials are frequently used by mystics, while some modern materials are utterly ignored: materials like iron and copper, which humans are already familiar with processing, have been permeated with human volition. This does not change their physical or chemical properties but makes them more likely to participate in magical processes. %n%n Based on this classification, you can easily distinguish the originally chaotic sub-disciplines of mysticism according to the different levels of volition-dependency of various magics. You have outlined a series of mystical branches awaiting your research and categorized them in your notebook. %n

I think if I get the chance, I must change their kids' early education games to GregTech: Quantum Leap, so they can also learn a bit of GT's unique chemical engineering along the way (laughs). %n%n§cYou can now turn to the Multiblock Machine section to view some of the other functional chambers.§r%n%nFor every degree above the recipe temperature of 900K, energy consumption will be multiplied by 95%% (not counting overclocking). %n%nFor every degree above the recipe temperature of 1800K, the efficiency of one overclocking will be changed to 100%% (lossless overclocking). %n%nEvery voltage level beyond MV will increase the temperature by 100K.

gtqt.quest.db.410.desc=Each stage also has its own silencer, note the name is Simple Silencer (Stage).%n%nThe pollution emitted by silencers at different stages varies, and you can see the specific value on the block.%n%nIf you don't want your home to be surrounded by pollution, try to use advanced silencers.%n%nBloomery and coke oven will produce a small amount of pollution when working;%n%nMachine explosions(no matter caused by weather or voltage factors)will produce a large amount of pollution;%n%nMultiblock machines will discharge pollution once according to their silencer level in each round, and as the silencer upgrades, the pollution discharge decreases.%n%nPollution Effect%n%nRandomly give players a short-term weakness, mining fatigue, nausea, blindness and other potion effects according to the pollution gradient;%n%nWhen pollution is too high, randomly convert grass block in the polluted chunk to sand, water to lava, etc.%n
gtqt.quest.db.411.title=How to Build a Multi-block Structure (LV)
gtqt.quest.db.411.desc=Multiblock machines can be simply divided into two parts: functional chambers and various non-functional blocks such as machine casings and frames. %n%nNow you have learned about the main blocks, chambers, buses of multiblock machines, and there are four types of functional chambers waiting for you to learn. %n%nNote that you can click on each block in the multiblock machine interface in jei to see what blocks can be used to replace the block in this position, some blocks also have maximum or minimum quantity limits. %n%nSome multiblock machines can be connected in parallel to share some blocks. There are also some multiblock machines that can be rotated. You can hold a wrench and point it at the main block of the multiblock machine. If there is a rotation icon, you can rotate it. You can place the machine horizontally or upside down. %n%nSome multiblocks support independent bus functionality, which means each input bus uses items in the internal space independently to run recipes, thus preventing recipe crossover.
gtqt.quest.db.412.title=Multiblock Maintenance Hatch
gtqt.quest.db.412.desc=There are four types of maintenance hatches, each one stronger and more expensive than the last.%n%nFor now, you can only use this one. Basically, every large electric machine needs one of these, and it cannot be shared by multiple multiblock machines!%n%nRemember to bring your tools. Until the automatic maintenance hatch becomes available, you'll need tools to repair the machine once.
gtqt.quest.db.413.title=Multiblock Energy Hatch
gtqt.quest.db.413.desc=Used to input power to multiblock machines, with one available at each stage. %n%nEach energy hatch typically has a 2A input, so you can use two energy hatches to provide 4A power input, allowing the multiblock machine to exceed its current voltage limit for maximum operational efficiency. How is this achieved? I will provide a brief explanation. %n%nFor multiblock machines like the Electric Blast Furnace (actually, single-block machines as well), the mechanism for determining whether a recipe can operate or not is based on whether the recipe's power requirement is met. A 120eu/t recipe is called an MV recipe, which can either be 120V1A or 30V4A. Therefore, what players commonly refer to as ”dual hatch overvolting“ utilizes this mechanism, using two LV energy hatches to input 4A of low-voltage power to achieve MV recipe production. %n%nSometimes, the power input of multiblock machines is also limited by other factors, but you won’t encounter them for now.
gtqt.quest.db.414.title=Multi-Block Power Chamber
gtqt.quest.db.414.desc=Used to output power from multiblock machines, typically used by battery-type and generator-type multiblock machines. %n%nBasically it's the reverse of an energy cell. You don't need it right now, and even the lv one isn't very useful, so no need to make it.

gtqt.quest.db.429.desc=The grand plan of industrialization slowly unfolds. In your leisure waiting for the machines to work, you begin to ponder anew the shape of the world. %n%nYou have long read the gibberish in those complicated ancient texts. Before you, the pioneers dismissed these strange hypotheses with disdain - some denounced them as superstition, others named them phantoms, claiming they were but a poor parody of true knowledge. Indeed, under the light of Enlightenment rationality, 'essence' could only be one - this was an unassailable common sense. Whether matter or energy, information or life, these concepts must be classified into an absolute singularity, which people called §3Scientific Truth§r. %n%n You believe that while these views are correct, they overlook certain crucial aspects. The ancient sages frequently mentioned reason. You have long discovered that you are different from those bizarre monsters and docile animals. Even those friendly villagers cannot possess creativity like yours. What sets you apart from the mediocrities? What drives you to accomplish feats they cannot? There seems to be only one explanation - that is §6§lWill§r: it is your will that dominates this world, not the other way around. The world, or part of it, cannot exist without you. %n%nWhen this thought pops into your mind, you find your own conclusion laughable - isn't this the great fallacy of idealism? But you can never reject this judgment. Deep in your mind, your intuition tells you that from an angle you do not yet know... this might be true.%n
gtqt.quest.db.430.title=Oxygen
gtqt.quest.db.430.desc=This is probably your first encounter with gases. In the ancient GTQT beta version, holding a gas canister would make you float, like a human Wàn Hù.%n%nNow, you have two ways to obtain oxygen: extracting it from minerals or centrifuging air.%n%nI recommend centrifuging air because you'll also need a bit of nitrogen.%n%nYou can use oxygen in an electric blast furnace to directly smelt iron ingots into steel ingots, but for now, you need it to burn arsenic trioxide. Or perhaps you could consider centrifuging realgar ore powder?%n%nAdditionally, the arc furnace also requires oxygen. But that's something much later.

gtqt.quest.db.432.title=A Chronic Freeloader
gtqt.quest.db.432.desc=Enjoy freeloading? This machine can help you freeload various gases, provided there's enough voltage. A basic air collector is probably only capable of gathering some air from the Overworld, and it should also be your best source of nitrogen in the early stages. %n%n(If you power it with steam, it can collect a bit more air than the steam you consume)%n%nHere are two super tanks to store your oxygen and nitrogen.
gtqt.quest.db.433.title=Arsenic
gtqt.quest.db.433.desc=Arsenic is a chemical element with the symbol As and atomic number 33. It is a non-metallic element that usually exists in nature in the form of sulfides or oxides. Arsenic has a metallic appearance with a silvery-white luster, but it is actually a semi-metallic and semi-non-metallic element. %n%nThe common state of arsenic in nature is orpiment (As₂S₃), a mineral composed of arsenic and sulfur. In addition, arsenic can also combine with other elements to form various compounds such as oxides, sulfides, and halides. %n%nArsenic and its compounds have some industrial applications, for example in semiconductor materials, pesticides, glass, and pigments. However, arsenic and its compounds are also toxic, and long-term exposure or ingestion of arsenic may lead to health problems such as arsenic poisoning. Therefore, special care is required when using arsenic-containing products, and safety operating guidelines must be followed. %n%nYou need to use it to make gallium arsenide.
gtqt.quest.db.434.title=Gallium
gtqt.quest.db.434.desc=You can find gallium from bauxite or sphalerite. Previous tasks asked you to directly electrolyze sphalerite, but I think it’s better to process their byproducts instead. %n%nFor GT beginners: Simply put, process the cleaned sphalerite powder in a centrifuge, and then electrolyze the sphalerite powder. This method yields a lot.
gtqt.quest.db.435.title=The Core of Circuit Modernization
gtqt.quest.db.435.desc=As a second-generation semiconductor, gallium arsenide is known as the 'semiconductor nobility' due to its high cost. Gallium arsenide can be made into semi-insulating high-resistance materials with resistivity 3 orders of magnitude higher than silicon and germanium, used to make integrated circuit substrates, infrared detectors, γ photon detectors, etc. Because its electron mobility is 5 to 6 times larger than silicon, it has important applications in making microwave devices and high-speed digital circuits.%n%nTo obtain it, you need to fiddle with sphalerite and centrifuge some realgar.%n%nThe current version requires an industrial furnace to smelt it, it's no longer a mixer recipe.
gtqt.quest.db.436.title=Manganese Phosphide

gtqt.quest.db.440.title=Natural Alkali
gtqt.quest.db.440.desc=You still need some trona to process the latex, the byproduct of your resin treatment.%n%nTrona is an evaporite mineral, usually fibrous or columnar masses, gray, yellowish-white or colorless in color, with a glassy luster. It is mainly distributed in salt lake sedimentary areas and arid regions, sometimes forming large areas of alkali deserts. The main chemical components of trona are sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate, among which sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3·NaHCO3·2H2O) is a common and typical trona mineral, sometimes specifically called trona.%n%nTrona contains various impurities and needs to undergo a series of processing steps, such as making alkali liquor, clarifying, filtering, evaporating and concentrating, cooling and desalting, and melting, to produce soda ash, caustic soda, baking soda and other products. These products have a wide range of uses, such as soda ash for making glass, soap, textiles, paper, printing and dyeing industries, caustic soda for oil refining, papermaking, printing and dyeing, textile industries, and baking soda for food, medicine, firefighting and other industries.

Try checking jei yourself.
gtqt.quest.db.447.title=Aluminum
gtqt.quest.db.447.desc=Aluminum is the main consumable material in your mv phase, just as steel is in the lv phase. You need a lot of aluminum to complete your mv, so you can do a bit more.%n%nAluminum is a metallic element with the symbol Al and atomic number 13. Aluminum is a silver-white light metal with ductility, and is often produced in the form of rods, sheets, foil, powder, strips, and wire. Aluminum is a reactive metal, and in dry air, the surface of aluminum immediately forms a dense oxide film about 50 angstroms thick (1 angstrom = 0.1 nanometers), preventing further oxidation and making it resistant to water; however, aluminum powder mixed with air is highly flammable; molten aluminum reacts violently with water; at high temperatures, it can reduce many metal oxides to their corresponding metals; aluminum is amphoteric, dissolving easily in strong bases and dilute acids.%n%nAluminum has a wide range of applications, primarily in aerospace, construction, automotive, power, and packaging sectors. In the aerospace industry, aluminum is used to manufacture the structures and shells of aircraft, rockets, and other flying vehicles due to its lightweight and excellent corrosion resistance. In construction, aluminum is used to make doors, windows, curtain walls, roofs, and other building materials, offering aesthetics, durability, and ease of processing. In the automotive industry, aluminum is used to manufacture car bodies, engine components, and other parts to reduce vehicle weight, improve fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. In the power industry, aluminum is used to make wires, cables, transformers, and other electrical equipment due to its good electrical conductivity. Additionally, aluminum is widely used in packaging for products like aluminum foil, cans, and containers for food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and other products.

Let's start with something simple to get a feel for it. %n%n§cWarning! This quest requires many unique raw materials produced by multi-blocks in petrochemical engineering. Therefore, this is not a quest that you can complete in one go. Please refer to the Petrochemical chapter for details.§r%n%nPhenolic, also known as phenolic resin or bakelite powder, is a hard and brittle thermosetting plastic. It is a resin formed by the polycondensation of phenol and formaldehyde under the action of a catalyst, followed by neutralization and washing, among which phenol-formaldehyde resin is the most important. Phenolic resin is a yellow, transparent or translucent block or granular solid that appears slightly red due to the presence of free phenol, with a specific gravity of 1.25～1.30. It is easily soluble in alcohol, insoluble in water, and stable in water, weak acid, and weak alkali solutions. Phenolic resin, also known as phenolic plastic, is obtained by the polycondensation reaction of phenol and formaldehyde under the action of acid or base catalysts. It is the earliest synthesized class of thermosetting plastics. Although it has been gradually replaced by other plastics (such as polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, etc.), it is still widely used in insulation materials, adhesives, flame retardant materials, coatings, synthetic fibers and other fields due to its easy availability of raw materials, convenient synthesis, and excellent water resistance, chemical corrosion resistance, and electrical insulation properties.

gtqt.quest.db.457.desc=Sulfuric acid is one of the three basic acids that you will need in large quantities later on, but for now, you only need to produce as much as you require. Although the petrification task recommends that you directly electrolyze hydrogen sulfide to obtain sulfur powder for making sulfuric acid, I must tell you that using hydrogen sulfide to produce sulfuric acid is currently the most convenient method for you.%n%nSulfuric acid is one of the most reactive binary inorganic strong acids, capable of reacting with the vast majority of metals. Concentrated sulfuric acid has strong hygroscopic properties and can be used as a dehydrating agent to carbonize wood, paper, cotton and linen fabrics, as well as biological tissues containing carbohydrates. When mixed with water, it also releases a large amount of heat energy. It possesses strong corrosiveness and oxidizing properties, so caution is required when using it.%n%nSulfuric acid is an oily, colorless to slightly yellow amorphous crystal and is also an important industrial raw material. It is used in the production of fertilizers, pharmaceuticals, explosives, pigments, detergents, batteries, and is widely applied in petroleum refining, metal smelting, and the dye industry. It is commonly used as a chemical reagent and can serve as a dehydrating agent and sulfonating agent in organic synthesis.

gtqt.quest.db.493.title=Will·Meaning·Authority
gtqt.quest.db.493.desc=As a scientist and engineer, you have also come into contact with the hidden magical forces in this world. Before you began a comprehensive reflection, you simply understood magic as phenomena that could not be explained by the existing scientific system. Or to put it another way, you believed that only modern science was the doctrine that directly pointed to the essence, while all other claims that claimed to represent the essence of the world were merely objects that science could handle. %n%nNow, you believe that this understanding is not entirely wrong, but it is not comprehensive enough. After reorganizing your existing knowledge system, you are more certain that your previous thoughts on \"will\" are not false. The words of a mad philosopher in an ancient book caught your interest. He believed that will is the origin of the world, and that life has different levels of strength and weakness. Although you do not agree that will is the origin of the world, you do agree that the direct cause of certain phenomena in this world is indeed your will: without your participation as the subject, some \"miracles\" simply cannot occur. %n%n§6§lMagic is the science of causing miracles through human will.§rThis definition you have made accurately summarizes the essence of magic: the ancient sages took human will as a natural prerequisite for magic, but due to the interpretation of modern science, human will has been reduced to the fluctuations of brain waves under atomic theory, which led you yourself to not believe that you could cause miracles. In other words, your will has been greatly weakened in the process of rationalization in industrial society, and this is the real reason why you could not control magic before. %n%nYou decide to take a purely utilitarian attitude towards magic until you have studied the principle of will's influence on reality. You firmly believe that those who worship science as the supreme faith are foolish: they only know how to \"eradicate superstitions\" and clamor to reduce everything to science, but they bow down to science itself, so much so that humans have become tools for achieving scientific technology. The truth is exactly the opposite of their thinking. A true scientist, although determined to explain every phenomenon in the world, never claims that his research results are equivalent to the truth of the world itself. Science is an interpretation of the world, and it can only be an interpretation… Otherwise, it will lose its continuously developing vitality and become lifeless dogma, which is completely opposite to the scientific picture you know. %n%nKeeping certain links as black boxes and appropriately involving human will is the secret to the effect of magic. You believe that even if magic could be completely reduced to phenomena that science can explain by some method you do not yet know, it would still be very uneconomical, so why bother? Magic can simplify many cumbersome steps in industrial production and easily achieve many miracles that are difficult to achieve by ordinary methods. It is unbelievable that those pedantic guys have left this treasure trove unused for so many years. %n%n§6§o\"Knowledge is power, will is authority.\"§rYou write this maxim on your first research manuscript. %n

gtqt.quest.db.541.title=Geological Survey Plan
gtqt.quest.db.541.desc=The first step in will research is to reproduce the magic from those mystical theories recorded by predecessors, but unfortunately, obtaining large quantities of the magical materials mentioned in the records is quite troublesome in the Overworld, which limits the depth of your research.%n%nBefore this, you had initially explored the swamps of §2The Betweenlands§r. From the foul-smelling jars in that deep and dark dimension, you found fragmented words left behind by other adventurers in their final moments. From their accounts, you pieced together the origin of The Betweenlands: it appears to be a cursed land formed when a great wizard tried to teleport from overlapping realms to the Nether and botched the magic he was working on (historical records called that intelligent and powerful wizard §4“Revil O' Elcanrab”§r, who was proficient in the magical language §4§o§l“Java”§r, an essential tongue for ancient and profound verbal magic). In the dimension you live in, the "Overworld," those dark druids are pitiful lunatics who went mad after escaping from The Betweenlands.%n%nYou’re not really that interested in history, but you did gain some interesting inspiration from that "clever" sorcerer. If the records are accurate, opening a portal to another dimension seemingly caused the collapse of The Betweenlands, but when you opened a portal to the Nether from the Overworld, the Overworld didn’t collapse, and you didn’t know any magic at the time. This implies that The Betweenlands is a smaller, more closed-off world compared to the Overworld, with a much higher concentration of magical energy—something evidenced by the ridiculously strong evil natives there—making it far more difficult to open portals.%n%nOne piece of evidence is not enough, so you came up with a way to test your theory. If your deduction holds true, then compared to the magic-poor Overworld, The Betweenlands should theoretically be able to generate much denser magical minerals. In the Overworld, you’ve heard of people finding fragments of rare magical crystals; perhaps they exist in The Betweenlands as actual mineral deposits…?%n%nWith this in mind, the first adventurer in history to risk it all purely for ore set off for The Betweenlands.%n
gtqt.quest.db.542.title=Eureka!
gtqt.quest.db.542.desc=What an exciting Eureka moment, your theory has gained recognition from the world! Deep within the stench-filled, pitch-black swamp beneath a cavern, you discovered high-purity magical crystal ores. The purity of these crystals is simply unbelievable...%n%nPreviously, you studied the manuscripts of a mysterious mage named §aAlexander§r, who was active before the collapse and chaos of the Twisted Dimensions. In his writings, he pointed out that the world is composed of four basic elements: air, earth, fire, and water. However, based on your research, it is evident that there are six different types of magical crystal ores within the Twisted Dimensions.%n%nOf course, you wouldn't subscribe to the obvious fallacies in ancient texts that attribute this to divine arrangement or natural miracles. You speculate that during the catastrophic dimensional disaster in the Twisted Dimensions, the conceptual elements of order and chaos were also solidified, forming what mages today often refer to as the six elements. From a scientific perspective, this is another brilliant testament to voluntarism: the grand wizard attempted to alter the world with his will, to pierce a portal between two dimensions. Although his efforts were unsuccessful, they did indeed cause the world to yield somewhat to his will. You formulate a hypothesis, §6that order and chaos are elements created by human will.§r%n%nIn any case, you now need some samples, and these ores themselves are extraordinary and precious magical materials that cannot be obtained in the main world. Since elemental fragments can be found scattered throughout the world, as a last resort, you may also choose to explore the mines...

gtqt.quest.db.543.desc=
gtqt.quest.db.544.title=The Dawn of New Mysticism
gtqt.quest.db.544.desc=The nature of these ores is so fascinating... First, you discover that the ore components contained within these six ores, the solid forms of the six elements, do not belong to any element known to you, and exhibit a very idealistic, literal physical and chemical nature. Your reliable grinder has procured some samples for you, and after simple high-pressure recrystallization and forging hammer smashing, you obtained the fragments of magic crystals used by mystics.%n%nLater, you indeed had strange, peculiar dreams, exactly like the enlightenment process you had heard of from your predecessors. However, after calming down, you speculated that behind these peculiar dreams lies an ancient mystic legacy. Obviously, knowledge cannot be easily obtained by ordinary people who cannot even touch magic crystals. In ancient times, only true magic apprentices could access these materials.%n%nAccording to the legacy, the secrets of mystics are hidden in a secret manual called the Magic Guide. From your perspective, some of the 'astonishing discoveries' in the book can now be explained by scientific means, while others cannot be reduced to physical phenomena. You are particularly concerned about the latter, because according to your theory of will, this means that these phenomena are highly dependent on the participation of the mystics themselves.%n%nFor example, §dWorld Salt§r is something that cannot be explained by the existing scientific system at all, and even from a mystical perspective, it is quite marvelous. It can catalyze many reactions and turn ordinary things into mystical tools.%n%nYou produced World Salt using traditional methods and believe that, from the perspective of will theory, World Salt is actually another form of mystic magic inheritance—it can only be crafted by the hands of a mystic, and the crafting itself causes the world to warp. You had some villagers try to use World Salt, and they all failed, it seems their souls were too weak.%n%nSprinkling the salt on a bookshelf, you are ready to walk the path of the ancients once more, this time vowing to revive the mystic arts.

gtqt.quest.db.546.title=New Occult Branch 2: Botany
gtqt.quest.db.546.desc=§dBotany§r. This is a field of study that relies least on personal will, and is the closest to scientific industry among the new occult studies. However, the origins of this discipline seem deeply rooted in pure voluntarism.%n%nYou earlier discovered that the flowers and trees of this world contain magical power, which is undeniable. But why? Scouring relics from around the world, you gathered a large amount of ancient texts and believe that the reason those flowers possess such great power cannot be merely natural creation as claimed by ancient botanists. Ordinary poppies have pitifully little magic, while an ordinary red mystical flower can work miracles; such similar species could not have such stark "performance differences" through natural selection... You still don't fully grasp why the mystical flower is mystical, but you posit that it either isn't purely natural or drifted into our dimension from another: either scenario indicates that magical botany is far from natural.%n%nTransmissions related to botany are quite niche among mystics, as many ancient mystics looked down upon plants, making it rather difficult to start studying plant magic. Nonetheless, you managed to threaten and question those dark druids, and uncovered a method for creating a magical botanical encyclopedia akin to a grimoire. The method of transmission is similar to that of imbuing a blank book with knowledge, which bolsters your confidence in your theories.%n
gtqt.quest.db.547.title=New Branch of Occultism 3: Raritology
gtqt.quest.db.547.desc=§dRare Lore§r......The mystics of the past never envisioned the infinite potential contained within this field of study. They held a naive attitude of taking and demanding from this world, without carefully considering the mystical essence behind those crucial alchemical ingredients. %n%nYour research into Rare Lore actually began with a scarcity of magical materials. As a self-taught mystic, unlike the ancient mystics who had their own magic apprentices to command, you had to obtain all experimental ingredients yourself. This made you pay more attention to material utilization than your predecessors: For some rare magical specialties, throwing them into a crucible was simply too wasteful, a joke with non-renewable resources. %n%nThe purpose of Rare Lore is to tap into the potential of special rarities, efficiently creating more complex magical items or simplifying some cumbersome operations. Your research started from the Interlaced World, the most magical dimension you have encountered. Several unique mineral deposits and wildly growing plants there greatly intrigued you. What surprises could they bring you?%n
gtqt.quest.db.548.title=New Esoteric Branch 4: Digital Mnemonics
gtqt.quest.db.548.desc=§dDigital Storage§r，you did not anticipate this field of study in your previous research plan，for most people with a rudimentary understanding of modern physics，the idea of “digitizing” objects for storage is absolutely unimaginable，it sounds like the work of God. However，you believe that mysticism can explain why this storage method is feasible. %n%n§4This quest rewards you with 16 AE Setes Quartz，which you can use to unlock mystical research，do not lose it！§r%n%nFirst，based on your initial research，the world is filled with magic - according to ancient mystics，it is called mana，and mana can be further divided into six fundamental elements - they refer to them as Essentia，or Elements. You have been dealing with elemental ores from the crossover world for a long time，in your research，these so-called elements are completely different from the elements in modern physics：rather than being a substance，they are more like different forms of energy expression. Therefore，an “intentionally involved” object can generally be decomposed into combinations of elements through the alchemy of mystics，and conversely，elements can easily construct new objects. %n%nYou believe that the alchemy process of mystics is the research subject you need，behind the seemingly simple crucible alchemy lies the thought of §6“all matter can be reduced to basic elements”§r. The key here is to discover a core alchemical material，and after fiddling with your first crucible，you think that §aQuartz§r is the answer you are looking for：it has long been deeply integrated into human life and has been highly developed by mystics，for a long period in history，it has been used as a means to absorb excess elements in crucibles，which reflects the blankness and mediation of quartz. Precisely because quartz itself can be a pure element carrier，you speculate that it is feasible to convert matter into elements via quartz，and the reverse should also be possible. %n%nThe possibility of digital object storage excites you greatly. In your exploration of the Nether，you have discovered several types of quartz，their mystical characteristics fascinate you. Among them，the mining of §aSetes Quartz§r is undoubtedly a milestone：it is almost identical to ordinary quartz in terms of physical and chemical properties，but its magical properties are very different，displaying amazing plasticity. It is too superficial to understand it simply as silicon dioxide：compared to the silicon dioxide in the soil，this crystalline silicon dioxide may be able to change the entire industrial system. %n%nYou have drafted several possible enchanting recipes，now all that remains is to put them into practice. %n
gtqt.quest.db.549.title=New Branch of Occultism 5: Magitek Engineering
gtqt.quest.db.549.desc=§dMagi-Mechanics§r! You have long envisioned the integration of industrial machinery and mysticism. This discipline is purely applied and is your forte, so there's not much to explain. %n%nCurrently, you can only incorporate essences as auxiliary elements in industrial machines, which might make certain machines more efficient. To this end, a specially designed essence input chamber is essential. You don't believe you need to resort to cumbersome alchemy to solve problems; in fact, the vis permeating the world is readily available for you to "freeload." %n%nYour ultimate goal in magi-mechanics is to create machines that can replace mystical alchemy and even mystical infusion. Will it succeed? Who knows...%n
gtqt.quest.db.550.title=New Esoteric Branch 6: Magical Catalysis
gtqt.quest.db.550.desc=§dMagical Catalysm§r, a promising new discipline you have high hopes for. This mysterious subfield is closely related to Curiositology. Apparently, in theory, there are two types of catalysts that come into your view: one is the narrow-sense catalysts, which simply catalyze chemical reactions; the other is the broad-sense catalysts, encompassing anything that can accelerate industrial processes. %n%nYou first focus on narrow-sense catalysts. Modern chemical theory holds that chemical reactions involve the breaking of old chemical bonds and the formation of new ones, during which energy is either released or absorbed. You once believed that essence, on a physical level, was just a form of energy. However, experiments contradicted this idea, as the participation of different types of essences in reactions leads to vastly different, highly idealistic outcomes. %n%nHow to steer these idealistic outcomes toward your desired chemical products? You think that physically mixing several crucial mystico-raw materials might be a good path. After experimenting with different formulations, you finally determine that, in addition to the three major alchemical ingredients §aMercury§r, §9Salt§r, and §cSulfur§r, it is necessary to add some §lQuartz§r, §dAmethyst Powder§r, and §3Cat's Eye Powder§r, as their magical affinity is exceptionally good. This formulation can produce a rudimentary catalyst never before invented, and this rudiment has excellent mana-bearing properties. %n%nInterestingly, doping pure quartz with various materials has skewed the quartz's own accommodative properties, making the rudiment more unstable. To create a good catalyst base, among the six basic elements, you can only dope the three more 'active' ones, which significantly enhances the catalyst's activity. Unlike the powdered catalysts common in industry, the form of the magical catalyst in your design is a magical device: you need some mystico-artifacts to support your catalyst, maintain its stability, and compose the catalyst's shell. %n%nThe first few attempts were not successful, and you realize you had been too optimistic. First, it is clearly impossible to manually assemble complex alchemical devices and resonators into a small contraption. It was only after employing industrial machinery that you overcame the obstacles of such delicate operations. Second, the device is exceedingly expensive, requiring you to invest already scarce mystico-materials, and its synthesis is very cumbersome. Still, you firmly believe that it is all worth it, for when you finalize it, you will have a supremely perfect catalyst capable of overturning the existing chemical engineering system.
gtqt.quest.db.551.title=New Esoteric Branch 1: Ancient Esotericism
gtqt.quest.db.551.desc=§dAncient Thaumaturgy§r, you use this term to refer to all the old thaumaturgical achievements, and your attitude towards them is purely instrumental: anything that can be useful to me is worth preserving, otherwise it can be discarded. Before building your own theoretical edifice, it is only natural that you must walk the path of the ancients yourself.%n%nYou believe that there are only three core technologies in ancient thaumaturgy: §aArcane Synthesis§r, §9Alchemy§r, and §cEnchanting§r. Countless other inventions and techniques were developed based on these three. Therefore, the mastery and breakthrough of these three technologies should be your primary focus: theoretically, you must first learn these traditional skills before you can study other branches of thaumaturgy. You also discovered that the essence of Arcane Synthesis is simple vis infusion, Alchemy is the extraction, infusion, and transformation of essences, and Enchanting is the complex infusion of specific essences. This means that in essence, the three technologies are the same thing, which is to make things more 'essence-friendly'. The 'grand unified theory' of thaumaturgy seems to be on the verge of being unveiled.%n%nIn addition, many useful inventions of ancient thaumaturgy can be utilized by you. You are very interested in the core spellcasting of traditional thaumaturgy, and some gadgets from alchemistry are also helpful. As the most comprehensive and complete branch of thaumaturgy, ancient thaumaturgy is far from being exhausted by you...%n
gtqt.quest.db.552.title=New Branch of Esotericism 7: Will Application Studies
gtqt.quest.db.552.desc=§dThe Art of Will Application§r, the most enigmatic and deeply personal discipline of the occult. Of all the subjects, this is the one that eludes you the most; existing theories provide no help whatsoever. In principle, with a will strong enough, one could alter the very logic of the world’s workings, but to achieve the level of power described in ancient texts, like that of the legendary Archmage of Twisting Crossroads, requires a strength of will that seems inhuman. Is it even possible? Is the dream of an occultist shaping the world nothing but a delusion?%n%nYou have only two scattered clues… One is the phenomenon of “Distortion” recorded by the ancients, along with the dangerous sorcery associated with it; the other is using your own flesh and blood as a medium…%n

Remember, if you don’t yet have a plastic circuit substrate, go back and check the task from the MV stage!
gtqt.quest.db.566.title=I Got CPU’d, but I’m Loving It
gtqt.quest.db.566.desc=The central processing unit (CPU) is one of the main components of a computer. Its primary function is to interpret computer instructions and process data in computer software. Before the 1970s, CPUs were composed of multiple separate units. Later, CPUs manufactured using integrated circuits emerged. These highly miniaturized devices are known as microprocessors, with the most complex circuits of the CPU being divided into single, tiny yet powerful units called cores. %n%nIn a broad sense, the central processing unit refers to a series of logical machines capable of executing complex computer programs. This broad definition easily includes early computers from before the term 'CPU' became widely used. In any case, at least since the early 1960s, the term and its abbreviation have been widely adopted in the electronic computer industry. Although compared to earlier versions, the physical form, design, manufacturing, and execution of specific tasks of the 'central processing unit' have evolved significantly, its fundamental operating principles have remained unchanged. %n%nEarly CPUs were typically custom-made for large and specific application computers. However, this expensive method of customizing CPUs for specific applications has largely given way to the development of cheaper, standardized processors suitable for one or multiple purposes. This standardization trend began in the era of mainframes and microcomputers composed of individual transistors and accelerated with the advent of integrated circuits. ICs enabled the design and manufacture of more complex CPUs in very small spaces (on the order of micrometers). The standardization and miniaturization of CPUs have made this type of electronic component increasingly pervasive in modern life. Modern processors are found in everything from cars and mobile phones to children's toys. %n%n(Excerpted from Wikipedia because I’m too lazy to think of copy.)

gtqt.quest.db.571.title=Why can't GTQT be adapted to Cleanroom?
gtqt.quest.db.571.desc=Just kidding!!! We now perfectly adapt to Cleanroom! Although not many players have it installed.%n%nThe ultra-clean room is colloquially called a toilet by GT old-timers (you'll know why once you're done), and is a prerequisite for making advanced circuit boards and using some advanced recipes. The size of this white multi-block can be freely customized, you can make a very small one or a very large one.%n%nSee the main block's own introduction for more details!

gtqt.quest.db.592.title=Platinum Processing 1/6——Ultimate Goal
gtqt.quest.db.592.desc=Congratulations! You have obtained pure platinum. %n%n2 billion years ago, a massive meteorite formed by a planetary explosion impacted Earth, and various rare and precious metals emerged on the planet, giving birth to platinum. Platinum metal has widespread applications in fields such as catalysts, sensors, anti-cancer drugs, petroleum refining, and electronic device manufacturing. For example, it is used in the production of computer hard drives to increase storage capacity in multilayer ceramic capacitors and hybrid integrated circuits; in glass production for manufacturing liquid crystal displays; and as a dental restoration material. %n%nSince we consider platinum processing to be a relatively lengthy process, you can directly complete this quest without going through those complex tasks that require testing. However, accordingly, we will not provide the corresponding rewards.
gtqt.quest.db.593.title=The Abyss......
gtqt.quest.db.593.desc=This place is extremely dangerous! Make sure you have sufficient light sources prepared.

gtqt.quest.db.596.title=Platinum Processing 2/6——Final Objective
gtqt.quest.db.596.desc=Palladium was discovered in 1803 by British chemist William Hyde Wollaston from platinum ore. It is an indispensable key material in high-tech fields such as aerospace and aviation, as well as in the automotive manufacturing industry. Palladium is a silvery-white transition metal, relatively soft, with good ductility and plasticity, allowing it to be forged, rolled, and drawn into wire. Bulk palladium metal can absorb a large amount of hydrogen gas, causing its volume to expand significantly, becoming brittle and even breaking into fragments.%n%nIt is an essential material for EV machine casings, and you must produce it in HV now. Similarly, you can skip the chemical processing steps earlier in this quest, as long as you provide me with a set of palladium to prove you have completed the production line.
gtqt.quest.db.597.title=Large-Scale Titanium Ore Mining
gtqt.quest.db.597.desc=Both bauxite and ilmenite contain titanium. Theoretically, you only need to consider titanium smelting after reaching the moon. However, if you manage to smelt titanium before that, we have no objections.
gtqt.quest.db.598.title=Fantastic! You did it!
gtqt.quest.db.598.desc=Titanium is considered a rare metal due to its scattered presence and difficulty in extraction in nature. However, it is relatively abundant, ranking tenth among all elements. The main ores of titanium are ilmenite and rutile, widely distributed in the Earth's crust and lithosphere. Titanium is also present in almost all living organisms, rocks, water bodies, and soils. Extracting titanium from its primary ores requires the use of the Kroll process or the Hunter process. The most common compound of titanium is titanium dioxide, which is used to manufacture white pigments. Other compounds include titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) (used as a catalyst and for creating smoke screens for aerial cover) and titanium trichloride (TiCl3) (used in catalyzing the production of polypropylene).%n%nSimilarly, we allow you to complete the Titanium Quest directly here, but the rewards will be reduced accordingly. Titanium is a very important material used in the fabrication of all ultra-high pressure machine components.%n%nIn addition, titanium is a prerequisite material for the pure scientific manufacturing of Applied Energistics 2 without the use of occultism.%n

gtqt.quest.db.602.title=Titanium Treatment-3
gtqt.quest.db.602.desc=This is sponge t……titanium. %n%nYou will find that titanium can only be produced in a two-to-one ratio. This is, of course, because sponge contains moisture.
gtqt.quest.db.603.title=Platinum Processing - Main Line - A Lump of Mud
gtqt.quest.db.603.desc=From here, the grand platinum processing begins.%n%nYou need to start with platinum group sludge, which can be obtained from various different ores. Among them, Sheldonite ore has an especially high yield, so I recommend mining this when you can.
gtqt.quest.db.604.title=Platinum Processing - Main Route - Super Strong Acid!
gtqt.quest.db.604.desc=You need a very powerful acid to dissolve platinum and palladium, separating them from the other four even more stubborn platinum group metals. This mixed acid can be fully recovered.%n§aPlatinum processing uses a lot of cycled raw materials, so you'll need to adapt.§r (However, its recovery is not so obvious compared to GT5's recovery)%n%nDo you know what joke I'm about to make? Hahahaha, aqua regia is made of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, and a certain modpack...%n
gtqt.quest.db.605.title=Platinum Processing - Main Route - Solid-Liquid Separation
gtqt.quest.db.605.desc=The stubborn four have separated and solidified, allowing you to temporarily store them while awaiting further processing.

gtqt.quest.db.611.desc=Seems like purifying chemicals as a player, but in reality, GT purifies players.
gtqt.quest.db.612.title=Platinum Processing - Main Line - Further Separation...
gtqt.quest.db.612.desc=We need to separate further, and for this, the extraction chemical you need is sodium hydrogen sulfate, not in solid form but in liquid form. One reaction requires 21 sodium hydrogen sulfate powders. %n%nDon't worry, this can also be recycled losslessly. (However, salt and sulfuric acid do not come from only one place, meaning you cannot fully recover without completing the entire production line ^_^)
gtqt.quest.db.613.title=Platinum Processing - Main Line - Iridium and Osmium
gtqt.quest.db.613.desc=They are like a pair of twins. Their names are both so enchanting. %n%nThis path will eventually lead to the extraction of iridium and osmium. For now, you can ignore it!

gtqt.quest.db.618.desc=If you understand the title reference, take a moment to reflect on your age.%n%nUnlike chloroplatinic acid, when you treat palladium solutions, you only get this crude palladium powder.
gtqt.quest.db.619.title=The Flying Carapace
gtqt.quest.db.619.desc=It's really cool, why don’t I have this outfit in Warframe?
gtqt.quest.db.620.title=Super cheap batteries, why not get them?
gtqt.quest.db.620.desc=Even the most reluctant battery user will be won over by it.
gtqt.quest.db.621.title=Take Off, Wuhoo
gtqt.quest.db.621.desc=This can later be synthesized into a very good breastplate.%n%nIf you already have the benefits from the beta, forget what I said.
gtqt.quest.db.622.title=Armor of the Former Dynasty!
gtqt.quest.db.622.desc=Let's bring out everyone's favorite nano suit.%n%nIt's strange, but the nano suit doesn't seem to have much to do with nano technology.
gtqt.quest.db.623.title=This is what the computer lab in your university looks like
gtqt.quest.db.623.desc=It's really expensive, and you really can only make them one by one.
gtqt.quest.db.624.title=You can only install one type
gtqt.quest.db.624.desc=YOT storage tank is another storage option. It looks a bit silly, but actually... I haven't used it myself so I don't know. Give it a try and you'll find out.%n%nThe cost might even be a bit higher.
gtqt.quest.db.625.title=Unlock the Spirit Weapon
gtqt.quest.db.625.desc=Actually, it\'s about doping phosphorus into your wafer.%n%nAll the formulas require 480eu/t, you must have a photolithography machine and laser machine with voltage boost before considering this. Moreover, cutting such high-precision wafers requires HV cutting machines and a cleanroom environment.
gtqt.quest.db.626.title=The Strongest Alloy Furnace
gtqt.quest.db.626.desc=The alloy kiln can smelt alloys at an extremely fast speed! What's that?%n%nIt requires continuous consumption of magma. You may consider fetching a few more buckets to supply it.
gtqt.quest.db.627.title=Welcome to CNSA
gtqt.quest.db.627.desc=Our goal is to catch up () and surpass (), rapidly advancing our rocket technology to send our employees to the distant moon. %n%nAre you ready? Before progressing this questline, you should already have a cosmic ray detector and server rooms capable of providing computing power.
gtqt.quest.db.628.title=Explosion！
gtqt.quest.db.628.desc=Don't blow, little guy. %n%nThis machine won't actually explode, it will only turn your plate into a very dense plate. It can also craft ender pearls! %n%nRequires MV voltage because the voltage level needed by many plates is this one.
gtqt.quest.db.629.title=Rocket Fuel
gtqt.quest.db.629.desc=You need rocket fuel, regular oil and coal can't sustain flight through the stars. Don't worry, I think a hand-crafted amount will be enough.%n%nMaking rocket fuel requires at least an HV-grade chemical reactor.
gtqt.quest.db.630.title=Artificial Creeper
gtqt.quest.db.630.desc=The formula for these TNTs has not been modified yet, you can savor the exquisite design of GTCeu (really? )%n%nChoose a production line yourself, I don't care which one you choose.%n%n(If you have ample reserves of toluene, obviously TNT is the optimal solution.)
gtqt.quest.db.631.title=I examined it very carefully…
gtqt.quest.db.631.desc=Then I discovered that this high-tech blender is actually not part of the main quest??%n%nIt seems it really isn't a necessity, but I still feel like it needs to be done.
gtqt.quest.db.632.title=Interesting Method of Industrial Production
gtqt.quest.db.632.desc=You can now industrially produce ender pearl powder.%n%nTo transform it into pearls, you'll need to build an implosion compressor. Additionally, blaze powder requires HV voltage for mixing, which means you can also produce ender eye powder.
gtqt.quest.db.633.title=You! Need it!
gtqt.quest.db.633.desc=Future Need？
gtqt.quest.db.634.title=Stacking Fun
gtqt.quest.db.634.desc=In \"Dyson Sphere Project,\" the achievement \"Stacked\" can be accomplished by building boxes under your feet. Wow, isn't this just copying our mc? (Dog head for safety) %n%nYou need to stack three different types of plates to craft this.
gtqt.quest.db.635.title=When I saw the words 'first level', I knew something was wrong
gtqt.quest.db.635.desc=We still use the Galacticraft mod to construct our space exploration world view. This means, nesting dolls are inevitable. %n%nThirty-two §c is not §r all you need, as other components require some too.
gtqt.quest.db.636.title=I Can't Breathe
gtqt.quest.db.636.desc=If my skin color is not correct, I can still breathe freely in the MC world. But if my IQ is so low that I don't even bring an oxygen mask for space exploration, I can't breathe. %n%nThis oxygen mask needs to be equipped on your galaxy gear slot like an accessory. %n%nYou will need a bit of silicone rubber.
gtqt.quest.db.637.title=Supply Oxygen
gtqt.quest.db.637.desc=Anyway, you have to make one, or you're screwed.
gtqt.quest.db.638.title=Source of Oxygen?
gtqt.quest.db.638.desc=Should be using this one, right? No, no. Oh yes, yes, it's this one. %n%nYou also need a compressed oxygen one. It's best to have the oxygen transmission close-fitting, otherwise you'll need a very difficult-to-make GC fluid pipeline.
gtqt.quest.db.639.title=Cursed energy system
gtqt.quest.db.639.desc=Power supply is a very disgusting thing, but I found through testing that it can be powered by a capacitor bank. Attach it to the side, and you'll have electricity. %n%nIn addition, you can also choose the galaxy's own power generation method, but I feel it's not as good as the capacitor bank.
gtqt.quest.db.640.title=Canned Game
gtqt.quest.db.640.desc=Cans and humans compete for oxygen
gtqt.quest.db.641.title=Can I hear aliens talking on the Moon?
gtqt.quest.db.641.desc=This is designed to let you hear sounds even in outer space. It's not mandatory.
gtqt.quest.db.642.title=The remaining components
gtqt.quest.db.642.desc=Rockets are expensive. But compared to those complex production lines, this thing isn't particularly expensive either. %n%nHere, the navigation computer is the most troublesome. You need a pre-built cosmic ray detector to get its flash memory. Moreover, you also need to complete the first part of platinum processing.
gtqt.quest.db.643.title=One-Click Assembly！
gtqt.quest.db.643.desc=Congratulations! You still have a bit more work to do. %n%nRemember to check before going up into the sky if you have packed the oxygen you need. If you haven't cheated with teleportation, you'll need to carry more oxygen tanks and prepare rocket fuel for the return trip.
gtqt.quest.db.644.title=I Have GT Syndrome
gtqt.quest.db.644.desc=I thought that even GC's machines couldn't get wet in the rain. In fact, it's totally fine. %n%n You can power the fuel loader with a battery, or move the capacitor bank over. It should be placed next to the formed rocket platform.
gtqt.quest.db.645.title=A Small Machine to Improve Quality of Life
gtqt.quest.db.645.desc=The large mining drill is great, but there are many ores it can't mine, and the mining conditions in some places are really bad (we're looking at you, Overworld)%n%nYou can use this machine, it can perfectly mine all ores in a 3x3 block area, and only requires MV level power (!)
gtqt.quest.db.646.title=Small and Cute
gtqt.quest.db.646.desc=And it's also quite useful! You can use it to achieve some interesting functions.%n%nHowever, its efficiency can't keep up with other machines that have multi-block versions.
gtqt.quest.db.647.title=Damn, OP
gtqt.quest.db.647.desc=No by-products, no by-products, no by-products.%n%nBut it's still very OP.
gtqt.quest.db.648.title=The Gateway to Biotechnology
gtqt.quest.db.648.desc=You might need it, but not right now. %n%nThis machine is used for subsequent biological circuits, which are not simple, and HV can't handle it either. Anyway, just ignore it for now.
gtqt.quest.db.649.title=Do high-end mages wear gloves when doing that kind of thing?
gtqt.quest.db.649.desc=In some fragmented historical records, you discovered that ancient mystics seemed to use something called a staff to cast spells. A staff is a long, wooden stick-like tool for casting spells. Strangely, you noticed that most mystics back then were women. What secrets lie within? Your intuition tells you it's best not to delve too deeply.%n%nYou think that staff-like things are very outdated. They were designed to extract vis from high-density spiritual fields, but vis is everywhere now, so why bother extracting? Ancient mystical research - a pair of magic gloves looks quite nice. You don't engage in much fighting and killing now, but this little contraption still holds value. %n%nBy the way, using gloves for that sort of thing, er, casting spells here, has a unique flavor to it.
gtqt.quest.db.650.title=Freeloading Algae
gtqt.quest.db.650.desc=Someone on Baidu Tieba once tried to meet daily human nutritional needs by cultivating algae. You can now use this machine to grow algae at home! %n%nThe produced algae can be used for various purposes.
gtqt.quest.db.651.title=A reliable bag?
gtqt.quest.db.651.desc=Why? Did the ancient mystical envoys really need to prepare a special pocket just for the cores? Did they not have apprentices to help carry those unused cores, or was their backpack, like yours, stuffed full of various industrial tools?
gtqt.quest.db.652.title=Core of Spellcasting
gtqt.quest.db.652.desc=The things of ancient mystics now seem like toys to you. However, you have discovered that if you exchange uniquely functional cores with your peers (especially those witches), you might obtain some more useful core designs and perhaps even a bit of romance.
gtqt.quest.db.653.title=Alchemy, personally I think it's inferior to chemistry
gtqt.quest.db.653.desc=From your perspective with abundant modern chemical knowledge, alchemy is mostly a scam. Among the formulae recorded by ancient mystics, the most valuable are those involving complete transmutation of matter, where they could directly transform one substance into another, even changing the types of atoms involved. Strictly speaking, compared to chemistry, alchemy is actually more akin to nuclear reactions. (What an absurd conclusion?)%n%nMaking a crucible is a piece of cake for you, just rub some salt on an ordinary cauldron. According to historical records, ancient wizard apprentices might have to work for ten years just to afford their first handful of world salt. No matter the era, those who exploit apprentices are truly despicable.
gtqt.quest.db.654.title=”Advanced Alchemy“
gtqt.quest.db.654.desc=Your assessment is that the techniques of the ancient mystics were utterly primitive. They actually, actually, after obtaining pure essence, chose to store them in jars? Couldn't there have been a large industrial storage tank to solve this problem?%n%nYou believe that in a while, or ten whiles, this problem will be solved. For now, let's slack off for a minute.
gtqt.quest.db.655.title=Pesky pollution……
gtqt.quest.db.655.desc=Pollution has always been an issue for you. Although according to records, those rifts might be valuable, you still don't want to feel restricted in your own home every single day.%n%nYou can build an industrial machine to help you clean up the pollution. Incredibly, no knowledge of the occult is required.
gtqt.quest.db.656.title=Spark of Magic Infusion!
gtqt.quest.db.656.desc=You prophesied it early on! If there's anything commendable about technology, according to the Ancient Mystic Envoy, it would be Arcane Infusion. Compared to the simple extraction and synthesis of ambient spiritual energy in an Arcane Workbench, Arcane Infusion means directly infusing complex magical energies—elements—into specified items.%n%nYour research has revealed that compound elements can all be decomposed into fundamental elements. However, as in many other instances, infusing an item with the elements of fire and order is quite different from infusing it with the element of energy. The subtle distinction lies in the difference in their mystical significance: fire and order are distinct from each other, while energy implies the singular concept of \"energy.\" You speculate that if it were merely a matter of infusing energy, such a complex matrix design would not be necessary. This insight should aid you in later improvements to the infusion device.%n%nBy the way, you will need a substantial amount of infusion stabilizers. You conjecture that different kinds of candles might be of assistance.
gtqt.quest.db.657.title=Back to Basics
gtqt.quest.db.657.desc=A scholar's primary role is research. You have adopted a more conventional approach, abandoning the inspiration-based method discussed by your predecessors. You believe that writing some manuscripts is still more reliable than waiting around for inspiration to strike.%n%nHowever, it is less a matter of research and more a case of retreading the footsteps of those who came before, with no real element of innovation involved.
gtqt.quest.db.658.title=old fashioned
gtqt.quest.db.658.desc=This piece of equipment remains the same—ancient yet effective. Without it, performing alchemy and enchantment activities would be difficult.
gtqt.quest.db.659.title=From One to Nine
gtqt.quest.db.659.desc=Now you no longer need to worry about running out of essence for your arcane workbench. (Although you still feel that your efficiency in utilizing the spiritual energy of each location is a bit too low)
gtqt.quest.db.660.title=Super useful lighting facilities
gtqt.quest.db.660.desc=I heard this kind of lamp used to be quite expensive, but you've found an efficient way to manufacture it. Just two or three of them can light up your entire base.
gtqt.quest.db.661.title=What's next?
gtqt.quest.db.661.desc=Basically, the enlightenment that the ancient mysteries can give you ends here. The series of new magical disciplines you conceived earlier must rely on existing occult technologies, especially arcane infusion, to develop.%n%nYou deeply feel that your lifespan is limited, while knowledge is infinite…
gtqt.quest.db.662.title=Rare Treasure - Cymo Copper
gtqt.quest.db.662.desc=This copper-like metal from the intersecting worlds cannot be found in veins in the intersecting worlds, only scattered mineral clusters. After in-depth analysis, you discovered that this metal is actually copper, but naturally doped with earth elements and crystal elements. This makes its properties more stable, and it cannot be made into lethal weapons, but it is perfect for making armor. %n%n Naturally, you cannot be satisfied with the natives' wasteful approach of making such precious magical metal into armor. You believe it to be a fine material for making mystical ingots! The only problem is that the excess crystal elements need to be removed.
gtqt.quest.db.663.title=Curiosity - Scab Crystal
gtqt.quest.db.663.desc=In the deepest part of the cave, you found two even rarer types of ore: one is not very useful, while the other is extremely precious.%n%nThe Scab Crystal is the relatively less useful of the two rarities. It seems to be the product of amethyst undergoing dimensional transmutation, infused with elements of tools. Its properties are relatively stable, and it doesn't interact much with vis, making it quite suitable for crafting magical containers. As for the way the natives use it? Good heavens, using such a versatile alchemical material to maintain weapons, who would have thought...
gtqt.quest.db.664.title=Rarity - Blazing Iron
gtqt.quest.db.664.desc=It's like a pair of sisters with completely different personalities alongside Semerton. Semerton is a steady metal, only suitable for making armor and other protective gear, while Flaming Iron is a very violent metal, most suitable for making tools. %n%nYou are mainly concerned with its mystical properties: it naturally contains elements of fire and light, and when stripped of its magical dimension, it is essentially a type of iron. The base of Mystic Ingots is precisely iron, and you already have some great ideas for mass-producing Mystic Ingots using less magical methods…
gtqt.quest.db.665.title=Rarity: Farona
gtqt.quest.db.665.desc=After accidentally falling into the stagnant water of an underground cave multiple times, you were nearly driven insane, to the point where you didn't even feel excited when you found this gem. However, this extremely rare treasure, commonly known as the 'Interlaced Diamond,' is indeed a valuable treasure!%n%nIt is a collection of contradictions in itself: both filthy and pure, ever-changing yet eternal. Its resonance effect with vis is particularly prominent, and that's just its simplest property. It's worth crafting a powerful enchanted pickaxe just for it.
gtqt.quest.db.666.title=Do I still need a tutorial at this point?
gtqt.quest.db.666.desc=You always feel that these components in your hands are very familiar, as if you've been dealing with them since many lifetimes ago. Why is that?
gtqt.quest.db.667.title=Embryo Technology
gtqt.quest.db.667.desc=The secret of the Occult \"Embryo Technology\" lies in creating a substrate that can supply magical reactions. It's only natural that it can't be achieved overnight.
gtqt.quest.db.668.title=Mystery Ingots without a Crucible? Impossible!
gtqt.quest.db.668.desc=Now you can laugh out loud at those foolish ancient mystics. This extremely hard, difficult-to-process, magic-affinity alloy was once incredibly rare and expensive. While this synthesis route may not make it cheaper, it at least won't cause curse-wave pollution anymore.%n%nThe principle behind this reaction isn't all that complicated either. The excess essence spontaneously combines to form redstone, a substance representing energy, leaving behind nothing but copper devoid of magic.
gtqt.quest.db.669.title=Efficient Resonator Production
gtqt.quest.db.669.desc=By putting Ferrosodium to use, you can immediately produce two types of resonators efficiently, which have incredibly wide applications in the field of Occultism. And this is just the beginning! It's capable of much more than that.
gtqt.quest.db.670.title=Efficient vis Battery Production
gtqt.quest.db.670.desc=Perhaps you don't need this recipe, but it's always a good thing that it exists.
gtqt.quest.db.671.title=Exceptionally Expensive Catalyst
gtqt.quest.db.671.desc=The production of the catalyst is no simple matter. It requires nearly all thaumaturgical techniques, even the involvement of paradoxical substances. However, it's all worth it. %n%nThe catalyst core you ultimately obtain is an alchemical apparatus containing infinite possibilities, its interior constantly changing. It just needs one more infusion to become a catalyst with different functions.
gtqt.quest.db.672.title=I Don't Think Salt is a Scarce Resource in Modern Times
gtqt.quest.db.672.desc=You don't think so either. Just stir it! %n%nHowever, it seems a bit too industrialized... It's not really the same thing as the world salt permeated with the will and legacy of our predecessors, just with similar physical and magical properties.

gtqt.quest.db.679.title=Some History!
gtqt.quest.db.679.desc=GregTech: Quantum Leap (abbreviated as GTQT) is a continuously updated 1.12.2 GregTech Community Edition unofficial modpack (GTCeu) with extensive modifications. GTQT boasts a massive amount of original content, so much so that even the changelog is difficult to write. The author is still in an active update and development frenzy (as of October 2024)! %n%nThis modpack was forced to start over in 2023 due to GTCeu's destructive modifications. Since then, the modpack has been split into Old QT players and New QT players. Old QT is no longer maintained and is not recommended for play. %n%nThe old and new versions of GTQT are completely different! The new QT is also called GTQTR (reboot/remake) and features significant changes! %n%nHere’s something nice to help you record your own history.
gtqt.quest.db.680.title=Primitive Doesn't Necessarily Mean Ineffective
gtqt.quest.db.680.desc=Using violent modern methods to synthesize the tools of primitive people is exactly what you're doing.%n%nYou find these plant mages absolutely awesome. Their techniques are so primal, the mana pool is such a rudimentary facility, yet its function is incredibly powerful. The mana you've been searching for in vain is easily stored, the only drawback being that you can't contain it in mundane vessels. But who cares?
gtqt.quest.db.681.title=Feeling puzzled?
gtqt.quest.db.681.desc=Step 1: Check if 《Baby Early Education》 contains the answer to your question. %n%nStep 2: Check if the corresponding chapter in the quest book contains the answer to your question. %n%nStep 3: Consider whether the problem you encountered is a modded or vanilla issue, then search for information on the mcmod website. %n%nStep 4: If all the above methods fail, join the group and ask the lovely group members.
gtqt.quest.db.682.title=Everything is ready!
gtqt.quest.db.682.desc=It's time for practical combat! Your productivity will receive a huge boost! Your liver function will also be greatly reduced...
gtqt.quest.db.683.title=Essential Alloy
gtqt.quest.db.683.desc=No machinery can do without high-strength alloys, but here you need more than just strength...you also need affinity with the elements. Different magical devices obviously require different elements to support them. For example, if you want a good centrifuge, you'll need the wind element to work with you, and ordinary materials simply can't carry the wind element.%n%nYou've designed a series of alloys, known as elemental alloys, with a status somewhat similar to the pure industrial mega-machine alloys. With them, you can channel all simple and composite elements.
gtqt.quest.db.684.title=Delve into Reality……
gtqt.quest.db.684.desc=It's time to delve deeper into reality. You believe that reality is not just what you can see with your eyes, that you can perceive much more, so much more...%n%nAccording to theory, the \"magic\" that those Plant Mages promote is actually another manifestation of the vis mentioned by Mystics. If vis is considered an invisible and shapeless gas, then magic is a tangible liquid, much like the difference between water and water vapor - seemingly different, but essentially the same. Therefore, even without relying on the power of plants, you can create §9Magic Steel§r - in your view, this is merely a very basic alloy.%n%nYour ambition doesn't stop here. If you combine the techniques of Plant Mages with those of Mystics, you can achieve something that overturns reality!%n%n(It must be mentioned that creating Magic Steel without Plant Magic is quite inefficient. You feel that if you are to use Magic Steel in large quantities, it would be better to delve back into Plant Magic.)%n
gtqt.quest.db.685.title=Tracing the Stars...
gtqt.quest.db.685.desc=Combine enchanted steel powder, mysterious powder, and world salt in a 3:2:1 ratio and stir. This ratio, like the ancient black powder ratio, seems to inherently contain magic. %n%nThe new alloy you've created has, to some extent, transcended material reality. It's a perfect vis conductor and magic conductor, like a gift from another world. %n%n§o§dYou named it Manastral Steel.

gtqt.quest.db.693.title=We are pests, we are pests...
gtqt.quest.db.693.desc=We are probiotics！%n%nWith this machine, you'll find that there are very, very many bacteria that can be cultivated. As for which one you want, I don't know.
gtqt.quest.db.694.title=Platinum Processing 2/6-Na Na Na~

gtqt.quest.db.695.title=Platinum Processing 2/6-The LCM Problem That Has Been Bothering Me
gtqt.quest.db.695.desc=Do you know the LCM of 144 and 1000? We veterans know it's 18000 without even calculating. %n%nAs for why we need to calculate this, take a look at the formula.
gtqt.quest.db.696.title=This is an ev mission
gtqt.quest.db.696.desc=But being rebellious, I wrote it in hv. %n%nIt's an essential machine for bacterial circuits, used to cultivate the bacterial strains you need, along with a set of smelly and lengthy chemical processes.
gtqt.quest.db.697.title=This shape is so familiar yet uncomfortable
gtqt.quest.db.697.desc=Vividly familiar, intensely discomforting.%n%nUsed in the crafting of certain specific formulas. If you aim to lay the groundwork for bioengineering at this stage, you will need it.
gtqt.quest.db.698.title=tps Lifesaver
gtqt.quest.db.698.desc=Salute to the legendary King of Pileup, GTQT's super player \"Ninth Empty Memory\". His name will be forever engraved in the quest book, as he piled up 256 thermal centrifuges, causing his home's TPS to be only half of what it was before. %n%nIt requires at least aluminum to operate.

gtqt.quest.db.700.desc=A: I just hope you can spend your time enjoying GT!%n%nB: So annoying!
gtqt.quest.db.701.title=You Are My Eyes
gtqt.quest.db.701.desc=You are my eyes, I am yours❤%n%nYou will need an implosion compressor, or you could try the Table of the Peacemakers. The purpose of this quest is to pay tribute to GTCeu's tireless assistance to peace-loving players.
gtqt.quest.db.702.title=That's it? Trash dragon~
gtqt.quest.db.702.desc=Trash~ Trash~%n%nCan't even take down half of my HP~ A trash that can only heal itself with crystals~
gtqt.quest.db.703.title=Break Free from the Cage
gtqt.quest.db.703.desc=For a long time, you have been fascinated by the catalytic process of chemical reactions. You believe that by utilizing specially crafted magical materials, you can achieve some similar \"catalytic reactions.\" In fact, they are completely different from ordinary catalytic reactions, and are much closer to alchemy in nature. These reactions are permeated with the will of the mystics: by attaching meaning and the proximity of materials to achieve reactions, which can be said to be quite unscientific. Interestingly, even such reactions can sometimes be written as chemical formulas.%n%nFinally, through your relentless efforts, you have condensed those catalysts into machine blocks, and all the research in magical catalysis has come to fruition! Use this machine to break free from the constraints of free energy! It is exceptionally expensive, but also worth it (hopefully).%n%nSwitch to the second mode in the machine's GUI interface to execute some special catalytic recipes! Of course, you can also use it as an ordinary machine, I have no objections. Magical catalytic reactions can be considered a small skip in chemical reactions, but this machine can also be seen as a reactor for creating new catalysts.
gtqt.quest.db.704.title=Are We in the Age of Degenerate Dharma?
gtqt.quest.db.704.desc=Based on your further research, you discovered that you are very likely living in the 'End Times of Thaumaturgy'. Legend has it that during the golden age of thaumaturgy (referred to as the Fourth Age by ancient thaumaturges), thaumaturges only needed to place natural aura nodes into a special device to tear open the boundary between this world and the beyond, summoning endless pure vis. Nowadays, while vis is everywhere, its concentration has significantly decreased, and if not careful, depleting it can lead to pollution issues.%n%nAnother piece of evidence that you are in the end times is that your main world lacks the abundant magical energy of the Betweenlands, making it extremely difficult to obtain even the most basic primal fragments or the liquid essences needed to power machines. You really don't want to spend all day mining in that stinky world.%n%nFortunately, this problem has now been solved. You designed a highly complex and massive magical device, almost the pinnacle of magical machinery!%n%nAt its core, it is a magical array that automatically collects the aura of the current chunk and converts it into primal elements. Taking advice from some Eastern thaumaturges, you named it the Essence Gathering Array. Simply power it up, and you can easily collect the fluid forms of the six basic essentia, and the speed is really fast. This machine can also switch to focus mode to collect a specific fluid you need. If the chunk's pollution is too high, its efficiency will be severely reduced.%n%n§cThe only drawback is that this machine is incredibly difficult to build...§r%n%n§oReference data: Single fluid collection rate formula per tick%nFinal production rate=Base production rate*(2^(voltage level-1))*ln(chunk aura)*(1+coil level)*(1-chunk pollution/chunk aura)

gtqt.quest.db.802.title=Tungsten Processing - Final Goal
gtqt.quest.db.802.desc=Tungsten is a non-ferrous metal and also an important strategic metal. Tungsten ore was called \"heavy stone\" in ancient times. In 1781, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele discovered scheelite and extracted a new element acid - tungstic acid. In 1783, the Spaniard Fausto Elhuyar discovered wolframite and also extracted tungstic acid from it. In the same year, tungsten powder was obtained for the first time by reducing tungsten trioxide with carbon, and the element was named. The content of tungsten in the earth's crust is 0.001%%. About 20 tungsten-containing minerals have been discovered. Tungsten deposits are generally formed along with the activity of granitic magma. After smelting, tungsten is a silvery-white lustrous metal with an extremely high melting point and great hardness. Tungsten is the metal with the highest melting point.%n%nBy the way, there is another route for tungsten processing that requires flash evaporation, you can choose by yourself. It is not recommended to smelt it into tungsten ingots, what you need in EV is its alloy form.

gtqt.quest.db.805.title=High-grade Steel
gtqt.quest.db.805.desc=Tungsten steel, also known as cemented carbide, refers to a sintered composite material containing at least one metal carbide. Tungsten carbide, cobalt carbide, niobium carbide, titanium carbide, and tantalum carbide are common components of tungsten steel. The grain size of the carbide component (or phase) usually ranges from 0.2 to 10 microns, and the carbide grains are bonded together using a metal binder. The binder is usually cobalt metal (Co), but for some special applications, nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), or other metals and alloys can also be used.
gtqt.quest.db.806.title=Platinum Processing - Main Line - The Most Acid-Resistant Metal?
gtqt.quest.db.806.desc=Iridium might be the most chemically resistant among the platinum group metals. We start with sodium chlorate.%n%nBy the way, you can use this to catalyze the electrolysis of water, although it has been weakened and is not as strong as before.

gtqt.quest.db.830.title=Platinum Treatment-4/6 - Ultimate Goal
gtqt.quest.db.830.desc=The discovery of iridium is closely related to platinum and other platinum group elements. The ancient Ethiopians and various South American cultures have used naturally occurring platinum metals since antiquity, which must have contained small amounts of other platinum group elements, including iridium. In the 17th century, Spanish conquistadors discovered platinum in what is now Chocó Department, Colombia and brought it to Europe. However, it was not until 1748 that scientists discovered it was not an alloy of any known metal but a brand new element.%n%nAt the time, chemists studying platinum placed it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid), thereby producing soluble salts. The resulting solution always left a small amount of dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Proust had thought this residue was graphite. French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed this black residue in 1803, but the quantity was too small for further experimentation. %n%nIn 1803, British chemist Smithson Tennant analyzed the residue and deduced that it must contain a new metallic element. Vauquelin washed the powder back and forth in acids and bases, obtaining a volatile oxide. He believed this to be the oxide of a new element and named the new element "ptene

gtqt.quest.db.878.title=Germanium Processing——Final Objective
gtqt.quest.db.878.desc=Germanium, tin and lead belong to the same group in the periodic table, and the latter two were discovered and utilized by ancient people, but germanium had not been mined on an industrial scale for a long time. This is not because germanium is scarce in the earth's crust, but because it is one of the most dispersed elements in the earth's crust, and germanium-containing ores are rare. %n%nMendeleev predicted its existence in 1871, and 14 years later, the German chemist Winkler discovered germanium in 1885 while analyzing argyrodite. Later, germanium was obtained by heating germanium sulfide with hydrogen. Mendeleev named it ekasilicon. In 1886, Winkler, a professor of analytical chemistry at the Freiberg Mining Academy (TU Bergakademie Freiberg in the 21st century) in Freiberg, Germany, analyzed a new ore discovered near Freiberg - argyrodite (4Ag2S·GeS2), and discovered an unknown new element, verifying his deduction through experiments. The element germanium was finally discovered.

gtqt.quest.db.1023.title=Lesson One, Know JEI
gtqt.quest.db.1023.desc=JEI is a Minecraft Mod for viewing items and recipes, built from the ground up with a focus on stability and performance. With over 250,000,000 total downloads on CurseForge, it ranks as the most popular mod and is widely recognized as a classic.%n%nSimply put, it is a tool mod for quick queries about various items. Instead of teaching you every single feature, I’ll just show you the most useful ones. First, you can press E to open your inventory menu. At this time, many items will appear on the right side of your interface, and there’s a search bar at the bottom right. Most people use that search bar to look up the item they want to find!%n%n§6If you notice that everything has suddenly dimmed, it’s likely because you double-clicked the search bar, which highlights the searched item and dims everything else. Double-click again to exit this state.§r%n%nIn the inventory state or many other states, the default search functionality is triggered by pressing the §au key and r key§r. Hover your mouse over an item of interest and press U to view items that can be §acrafted with it§r. Press R to view the §arecipe for crafting that item§r. Generally, these two features are all you need, along with perhaps adding items to your favorites by pressing A!%n%nThe unique JEI features in the GT modpack are provided by JEI addons, such as searching for multiblock structures, tool information, and mineral processing lines. The logic is similar; in most cases, you press the U key. For example, if you want to know the recipe for the Primitive Pump, find the main block of the Primitive Pump and press R to see how to craft it. Pressing U will let you preview what the multiblock structure looks like. Another example: if you want to know which mineral processing route produces Chrome, search for “Chrome Dust” in the search bar, then click on it directly or press R to view the processing path.%n%nAdditionally, the search bar supports initial-character searches. For example, typing “gygl” will bring up the Industrial Blast Furnace. Go give it a try! (This isn’t a native JEI feature; it’s likely provided by a Pinyin function mod.)
gtqt.quest.db.1024.title=Lesson 2, Understanding Modders
gtqt.quest.db.1024.desc=GTQT is a heavily modified modpack centered around GregTech. The question is, many players don\'t even know what modification is, or what GT is. %n%nGenerally speaking, modification refers to altering the existing gameplay of native mods and adding various new content as a way of creating modpacks. The most common modification is changing recipes. In GregTech, the development logic of vanilla Minecraft is completely rewritten; you can\'t rely solely on your past ways of thinking to play the game anymore. %n%nBelow are some modifications in this modpack that might confuse you a bit. (Actually, some of these are GTCEu settings, where the mod itself has pre-modified vanilla; others are unique to our modpack.) %n%n§6Very important! I won\'t say it a second time; it\'s annoying to write this everywhere. If you ask me why it\'s written here specifically, I\'ll tell you because you\'re a smart one, and you can see it. We\'re not going to bother those who can\'t see it. §r%n%n1. Common vanilla recipes have been changed. For instance, now one log can only be crafted into two planks by hand, and crafting on a workbench isn\'t vanilla at all. Check JEI; for items you don\'t know how to craft, the only way is to look at JEI (even the developers do the same). These mainly target common vanilla items. %n%n2. Infinite water has been disabled in most biomes. This means water has become relatively precious; you\'ll encounter some methods of producing water later on. However, it\'s said that biomes like rivers and oceans still have infinite water. %n%n3. Very! Important! Don\'t think those non-workbench recipes from your past haven\'t been modified. A classic example is §6glass§r, which can\'t simply be made by smelting sand in a furnace anymore (Maya, one of the most frequently asked questions by novices in our large group top1). The correct official process, after smelting steel and reaching the late steam age, involves making glass powder from quartz sand and a pinch of flint powder first, then using a \"block\" mold to smelt glass in a steam alloy furnace. Complicated? We\'re just getting started. %n%n4. Very! Important! x2. Don\'t think the things that have already been modified only have one way of doing them. Taking glass as an example again, upon reaching the electric age, if you have oxygen, you can use an arc furnace to smelt sand into glass with a 1:2 ratio in bulk, more efficiently than vanilla. The problem is that novices often don\'t know about this recipe. The best way is to check JEI more often; many things aren\'t limited to one method. Similar items like chests, furnaces, and glass often have efficient recipes made with GregTech machines.
gtqt.quest.db.1025.title=Lesson 3, Getting to Know GT
gtqt.quest.db.1025.desc=What is GT? Its name might scare you a bit, with the reputation of being \"hard\". But since you've already clicked in to play, it makes no sense for you to still be afraid of it. %n%nI won't systematically introduce it here, but only mention the most important points that you will use immediately. %n%n1. Phased progression. GregTech has a very clear concept of phases. The first phase you'll face is the Stone Age, then you'll quickly move into the Steam Age, followed by layers of the Electric Ages. Each phase has its distinct features and challenges. Likewise, many things are locked behind technological barriers, for example, you need to reach at least the MV stage to play the Magic branch to use the Applied Energistics 2 mod. If you focus solely on industry without developing Magic, you'll have to wait until EV. %n%n2. GT-style crafting and mining. You need to use §aGregTools§r for crafting, and GregTech's unique §6Ore Vein§r system ensures that you don't have to worry too much about \"not enough ores\". The supply of ores usually comes faster and in greater quantities than your processing capacity. %n%n3. Dangerous machines. Many machines might harm you, even explode, ruining your base. Please carefully read the instructions we provide. %n%n4. Multiblock structures. GT's multiblock structures are diverse, most of them achieve a function through multiple blocks. I guess the first multiblock structure you'll make would be the coke oven... You can learn from that structure. %n%n5. Take it easy. Slow progress is normal. In your spare time, jump around on machines or chat happily in groups. Don't let the game play you(

gtqt.quest.db.1027.desc=Get out of here for asking that, hmph. %n%nCurrently, the dimension mod used in the GTQT modpack is Betweenlands, and it forces you to be born in Betweenlands and develop technology there. If you want to be born in the Overworld, you can choose to use the teleport command (there are hints on how to do it in the first chapter's quest), or modify the custom settings in config/drtech.cfg. %n%nMost people haven't played this mod much, so let me remind you in advance: the environment is pretty eerie, with lots of bugs, and it's a bit laggy. If you're playing single player, you can switch to peaceful mode, no need to be shy. %n%nIf you encounter strange phenomena or annoying debuffs, please check the Betweenlands entry on mcmod, which explains many features of this mod in detail. %n%n§cWarning: This mod seems to have its own shaders (or something else?) which may make it hard to see anything if you use the default shaders.

gtqt.quest.db.1030.desc=I only explain the most useful things. %n%nFirst, all electrical machines, almost all compartments, multiblock main blocks, GT pipes, etc. will have the GT tic-tac-toe grid setting. Specifically, you can see a tic-tac-toe-like grid when holding a wrench. Right-click using the wrench on the big center grid, which for pipes can mean \"connect the pipe here\
gtqt.quest.db.1031.title=How to solve line loss? How to solve power tripping?
gtqt.quest.db.1031.desc=The simplest methods:%n%n1、Place more generators, such as four generators + 4a thick tin cables to power all LV stage small machines in the early game. You need to ensure these generators can work continuously, especially steam engines.%n%n2、Switch to superconductors. This solves the line loss problem but not insufficient power.%n%n3、Use battery boxes. Battery boxes not only cache power but also provide a cheap way to deliver high-amperage current. For example, 2 generators + one fully charged four-slot battery box + four batteries can generally meet most of your handcrafting needs without tripping. You will definitely use batteries often later. Each machine also has a small battery slot that you can utilize.%n%nDon't forget, more generators require thicker cables.
gtqt.quest.db.1032.title=Why won't my machine work?
gtqt.quest.db.1032.desc=1、There may not be enough steam%n%n2、The outlet is blocked, you need to change the outlet to let the exhaust gas out. For details, please refer to the instructions of the GT Sudoku below.
gtqt.quest.db.1033.title=Puzzling Energy Chamber
gtqt.quest.db.1033.desc=The maximum current a power hatch can accept is 2a. That is to say, two LV power hatches can accept 4a current, allowing your multiblock to achieve MV level voltage, which is common knowledge everyone knows. If you didn't know it yet, now you do! See the multiblock page for details. %n%nHowever, some silly newbies might think they can use a single power hatch with 2a LV current to run a 64eu/t MV recipe. This is wrong, because the voltage step-up mechanism is only triggered when using two hatches. The correct way is to use two power hatches and configure two LV generators.
gtqt.quest.db.1034.title=Multiblock Mechanism
gtqt.quest.db.1034.desc=Many multiblocks have their own unique mechanisms. Here I want to emphasize a mechanism that many machines have, which is also frequently asked about. %n%nMany multiblocks have a shell upgrade mechanism, which is a shell upgrade system developed by GTQT itself. For example, multiblocks with \"Bronze\" material shells (such as bronze brick machine shells, bronze pipe blocks, etc.) can only support up to LV level recipes and have no parallel processing. On the other hand, multiblocks with \"Steel\" material shells can support up to MV voltage recipes. %n%nFor instance, in the petrochemical route, the distillation tower must be made of steel material, as making it with bronze material would be pointless. Another example is the miner, which many players like to use—without upgrading the shell, both voltage and parallel processing cannot be improved. %n%nIf you see many multiblocks with bronze shell previews, it likely indicates that they have this shell upgrade system. For details, refer to the explanations within jei.
gtqt.quest.db.1035.title=Can't Move?
gtqt.quest.db.1035.desc=Are you frequently seeing the message 'You feel restricted in movement'? This is a feature of GTQT's exclusive mod Pollution. This mod adds various negative status effects based on vis contamination from Thaumcraft 6 (which is also the origin of its name, although now it's not limited to just that...)%n%nTo eliminate pollution, you'll need to at least progress to the low-pressure stage and then craft an air filter. You can check the tc6 pollution value of this block by looking at the GUI in the top-left corner.
gtqt.quest.db.1036.title=Too Many Attacks
gtqt.quest.db.1036.desc=If you're tired of the monsters that keep attacking you one after another, you can just go into the settings and turn it off yourself.%n%nThe method is simple: locate the config folder in the game directory, and find drtech.cfg inside it. In this configuration file, change the true after various Events to false, and you're done.%n%nOther configurations can actually be DIY-ed by yourself.
gtqt.quest.db.1037.title=Shop System
gtqt.quest.db.1037.desc=This modpack utilizes both the Betterquesting (bq) and FTBQuests mods for quest lines. %n%nThe latter has now become a purely shop-assisting mod! You can go inside to do some interesting shopping. If you don't know how to open the ftb quest book, press E to open your inventory and look at the top left corner, there is a quest icon. %n%nHere's a gold coin for you.

gtqt.quest.db.1038.desc=Some things related to titanium. %n%nSince it won't be processed until much later, my recommendation is: throw it all away!
gtqt.quest.db.1040.title=Set Sail
gtqt.quest.db.1040.desc=This chapter's quest is not prepared for an experienced player, but rather assumes you know absolutely nothing about AE2. In GTQT, you can gain access to some AE2 items (but not all) by playing the magic branch during the MV phase, and unlock almost all items through the pure tech path during the EV phase.%n%nYou ask, what does it mean to know nothing at all? It means you've never even heard of how this mod operates... Rather than a quest line, the quest here may be more like a tutorial. %n%nIn any case, everything starts with AE2's most important resource acquisition and core items. You'll soon realize that GregTech integration cannot survive without AE2.
gtqt.quest.db.1041.title=Flux

gtqt.quest.db.1042.desc=For beginners, no matter what, you should first learn to use this. Without it, you can say there would be no AE system.%n%nWhat is an ME Controller? Simply put, it is the core controller of an AE network, and a network can be considered an independent logistics system or a computer. This controller is used to allocate the network's \"channels\
gtqt.quest.db.1043.title=Big Box!
gtqt.quest.db.1043.desc=ae2The most basic (but also the most powerful) feature of this mod is digital storage. aeThe network can store tens of thousands of different things, making it extremely versatile. %n%nGenerally speaking, there are two storage methods available for your use. Let me first introduce the most intuitive and easiest to understand one, the me drive, which you can think of as the hard drive of the ae network... It has 10 drive bays that you can insert storage disks into. %n%n When you put items into the ae network via terminal, the items are actually stored digitally. As for where they are stored on this network, that is something you can learn later on.
gtqt.quest.db.1044.title=Basic Cables
gtqt.quest.db.1044.desc=Among the various cables, the most important one is the glass cable, which is also a material for other cables.%n%nA regular me glass cable can support the transmission of 8 channels. This means that if you directly connect it to an me controller, you can only export 1/4 of the channels. This issue can be resolved later.%n%nDevices connected by cables or components belong to the same ae network. Various ae devices can be placed on the cables, and each device generally occupies 1 channel. For example, if 4 me interfaces + 4 me terminals are placed on a glass cable, all subsequent devices placed will not start.%n%nGlass cables can be dyed, and glass cables of different colors will not automatically connect to each other, but all cables will automatically connect to the default fluix-colored cable.

gtqt.quest.db.1069.title=Automatic Synthesis~
gtqt.quest.db.1069.desc=For a complete novice, explaining how this thing achieves automatic synthesis might be a bit too difficult.%n%nIt requires two things to work: an active ME interface in the network, and an idle CPU connected to the network. What does that mean? You'll find out later. By the way, you can also try making other terminals.%n%nMore tutorials will be presented in subsequent tasks.
gtqt.quest.db.1070.title=The Ultimate Solution

gtqt.quest.db.1071.title=ae2fc, I envy your talent
gtqt.quest.db.1071.desc=The author of ae2fc is a genius. All of his genius is condensed in this thing.%n%nWhat is it? Simply put, it adds the corresponding droplet items to your network based on the existing fluids in the network, each droplet corresponding to 1mb, which is one-thousandth of a bucket of that fluid. Thus, fluids and items become one and the same.%n%nWhen performing synthesis, the fluid pattern terminal can edit patterns containing fluids, but in reality, it sends fluids over to the me dual-input interface (you could send droplets if you wanted to, apparently?). This way, recipes containing fluids can be easily handled.%n%nAs for this fluid discretizer, all you need to know now is that your network must have one in order to enable ae2fc's unique pattern recipes. And you only need one.
gtqt.quest.db.1072.title=The two most basic network buses
gtqt.quest.db.1072.desc=Actually, I think it's more like an \"electrical device\". It is responsible for realizing various functions.%n%naeThe network needs a controller to operate these strange buses, and the functions that the buses can achieve are nothing more than io problems. These are the two most basic buses， one is to input into the network, and the other is to output from the network.%n%nA common misconception: the bus is very laggy. In fact, in the current 1.12 version of ae2, the bus has already been optimized, and it should still be usable.

gtqt.quest.db.1074.title=Complex and perplexing...
gtqt.quest.db.1074.desc=meThe Storage Bus is something that can be quite confusing to beginners. However, if we delve into how it works, it can be simply understood as 'turning the thing it's attached to into a storage space (hard drive) within the network'. For example, if it's attached to a super chest, the network can freely access the items inside this chest to participate in various tasks.%n%nThis Storage Bus can be attached to a Drawer Manager, allowing you to have a very affordable large-scale storage. But be careful! It may cause lagging.%n%nRight-click on the already installed Storage Bus to configure it, adjust the priority to make certain items prioritized or not prioritized to be stored into the container designated by the Storage Bus. 'Read-only' and 'Write-only' correspond to the logic of only storing into or only taking out from it, which sometimes can be useful.%n%nThe Storage Bus has special cooperation mechanisms with the me Interface. For now, you just need to know these.
gtqt.quest.db.1075.title=Fluid Version of the IO Bus
gtqt.quest.db.1075.desc=Actually, I used to use these two brothers quite a lot back then. They're pretty decent, I guess. %n%nOf course, they can't compare to the interface in terms of saving on channels.
gtqt.quest.db.1076.title=Soul of AE
gtqt.quest.db.1076.desc=The ME Interface is the core of AE, the most complex and indispensable key item, and also the core that demonstrates this mod's gameplay idea.%n%nIt has so many functions that I think it's impossible to cover them all in one quest. What exactly is it? Some say it's a special \"chest\
gtqt.quest.db.1077.title=What is a Subnet?
gtqt.quest.db.1077.desc=Subnet is a widely used concept, but in many cases, it only increases rather than reduces the learning curve for new players. %n%n Strictly speaking, in the official ae view, the most orthodox subnet is actually the special combination of the me interface and the me storage bus. §6The me interface has a very special function: §rIf network A is equipped with an me interface, and network B attaches an me storage bus to this interface of network A, then network B can access all items in network A. Through the configuration of that me storage bus, network B can both deposit items into network A and withdraw from it. At this point, we can certainly call network A a subnet of network B. %n%n Did you notice the problem? The term 'subnet' seems to make you think that one network cannot exist independently of another. In fact, some subnets can fully operate on their own; the concept of hierarchy is something that players imagine. In the example above, if network A has a storage bus attached to the me interface of network B, network B would then become a subnet of network A, and A and B can be 'mutual subnets.' %n%n So, whether the subnet concept is meaningful or not actually depends on whether the player knows how to use ae effectively. Some players might only stuff me drives into the subnet, while others place them in the main network, and there are players who simply don’t use subnets at all, making related discussions very complex. %n%n Based on my own gaming experience, using subnets is suitable for certain complex chemical processing lines and mineral processing. But for beginners, what could possibly go wrong with keeping everything in a single network? By the time they need subnets, they’ll have already outgrown the need for such tutorials, alas.
gtqt.quest.db.1078.title=Reduced Functionality
gtqt.quest.db.1078.desc=Evidently, it cannot store templates. This has led to it becoming a more purely io-focused interface.%n%nUse the fluids in jei for marking instead.
gtqt.quest.db.1079.title=Two-in-One!
gtqt.quest.db.1079.desc=This item is both an me interface and an me fluid interface, and operates identically for both io items and fluids.%n%nRegarding templates, please note that only the me two-in-one interface supports automatically converting ae2fc droplets into fluid form, whereas the me interface can only output droplets, not fluids. In other words, for recipes involving fluids, the two-in-one interface is generally more convenient.%n%nHowever, for more advanced and complex automation scenarios, you might employ other techniques.
gtqt.quest.db.1080.title=Expand!

gtqt.quest.db.1087.title=How long have you been waiting for this?
gtqt.quest.db.1087.desc=No nonsense, let me quickly tell you how to use automated crafting (vanilla crafting).%n%n1. Craft this blank template.%n%n2. With the template terminal open, find the crafting recipe you want to automate in JEI on the right, and click '?' to automatically import it into the template terminal.%n%n3. Click the arrow to import the template, take out the template and place it in an ME interface within the network.%n%n4. If there is a molecular assembler next to the ME interface and your network has an available crafting CPU, the 'Craftable' item corresponding to your written template will appear in the terminal. Click to craft.%n%n5. Wait for the crafting to finish, have a cup of tea!
gtqt.quest.db.1088.title=Alien Black Tech Synthesis
gtqt.quest.db.1088.desc=This molecular assembler can execute all crafting recipes that use a crafting table. Place it next to the ME interface and start enjoying.%n%nIf you find its interaction with GT tools is not ideal, when writing the template, remember to check the iron ingot-like button in the template terminal to make it a fuzzier match. This way, it will automatically call any tool that has durability left.
gtqt.quest.db.1089.title=Interact with GTTM Machine Automation
gtqt.quest.db.1089.desc=It's simpler and cheaper than using a Molecular Assembler. %n%nFirst, you should have noticed that the Pattern Terminal has two pattern writing capabilities：Crafting Patterns and Processing Patterns. The so-called Processing Pattern is actually something like this：the ae network is responsible for transporting the items in the pattern to this me interface (any nearby container that can hold these items will be automatically filled), and then the ae network doesn't care what these items do, just keeps waiting for the target product of the pattern to return to the network to complete the synthesis. %n%nBased on this, ae automation for single-block GT machines is very easy. %n%nFirst, use a screwdriver to right-click the machine's output to enable item and fluid input from the output. Second, use a wrench to align the machine's output with the me interface, and the me interface (whether it's a block or a panel) is attached to this output. Finally, enable the machine's auto-output and place the pattern in the interface. %n%n After you order the auto-crafting, the workflow will be like this：%n%n1. The ae network sends the items required by the recipe to the me interface. %n%n2. The me interface, due to its function, automatically outputs the items to the adjacent container - this GT machine. %n%n3. The GT machine starts working. %n%n4. After the GT machine finishes processing, it automatically outputs back to the network, completing the synthesis. %n%nIt's the same for multiblock machines, except that the me interface is pointed at the input bus of this multiblock machine, and then using something like a me interface/me input bus to point at the machine's output bus to collect the processed items.
gtqt.quest.db.1090.title=Apply Grey!
gtqt.quest.db.1090.desc=The GregTech Large Machine can easily interface with the ae network by using these special buses. Among them, the output type is the most effective, significantly reducing latency. %n%nHowever, the input type is also very useful because it can automatically tag items already in your network, as if the machine directly has these items in the input bus/chest. Thanks to this, it is the optimal solution for multi-block electrolyzers, GT turbine power generation, and other applications! %n%nIn fact, production lines are also most conveniently solved with these buses. Farewell, EIO!

gtqt.quest.db.1092.title=Thunderstorm Runaway
gtqt.quest.db.1092.desc=Whoa, no, my money!%n%nAhem. p2p, it\'s actually a means of "spatially connecting" two places. For example, if you input a redstone signal at one redstone p2p, then the other p2p (which has already been connected) will output the exact same strength signal. Other types of p2p work the same way.%n%nThe default p2p is p2p-me, which transmits network channels. For example, suppose there are network a and network b. If you use p2p on network b and attach it to the me controller of network a as input, then output those channels somewhere else using p2p, you can achieve the effect where network b only transmits channels and network a only provides channels. This can sometimes make wiring quite neat and efficiently utilize channels.%n%nAre you feeling a bit dizzy and unsure of the significance of p2p? Take the previous example - we know that a single glass cable in a network can only transmit 8 channels. However, if you use p2p, you can connect 8 p2ps to one cable, with each p2p transmitting 32 channels from network a. This way, by only using 8 channels from network b, we can efficiently utilize the channels from network a and transmit up to 256 channels.%n%nThese are just the basics, there are more functions waiting for you to explore! Check out the wiki for details.
gtqt.quest.db.1093.title=stuffHelp Me
gtqt.quest.db.1093.desc=ae2stuffThis mod provides something extremely useful, namely wireless. Wireless is a more powerful way of channel connection, which can make the ae cables in your base very minimal. (Of course, the power consumption is also astonishing.)%n%nThe method of using wireless is quite simple. First, make a wireless connection tool and a pair of wireless access points. Then, just connect them with the connection tool.%n%nYou might have already thought of it...paired with p2p, it can almost achieve a cable-free home!

gtqt.quest.db.1216.title=Cement Research Enthusiast
gtqt.quest.db.1216.desc=The key and core of electronic component preparation is electronic paste, whose quality directly affects the performance of thick film components. As an important component of electronic paste, resistor paste is widely used in fields such as military, aerospace, communication, and automotive industries after being prepared into resistors applied in thick film circuits. Ruthenium dioxide (RuO2) resistor paste is an important component of resistor paste. RuO2 boasts excellent catalytic activity, stable chemical properties, and is a metallic-like highly conductive metal oxide, widely used in fields like electrochemical catalysis, chlor-alkali industry, and integrated circuits. Resistors prepared with RuO2 have advantages such as a wide resistance range, low noise, strong resistance to reduction, tolerance to high power loads, and good long-term storage stability. Therefore, RuO2 thick film resistor paste occupies a significant proportion in chip resistors and thick film integrated circuits. The core technology and production capacity of ruthenium series paste in our country have not reached the level of developed countries, and the resistor paste required in some fields depends on imports. Our country has conducted a lot of research on RuO2 resistor paste, but there still exists the issue of unstable resistance between different batches.%n%n（[1]Chai Tan.

gtqt.quest.db.1237.title=Gahaha,I succeeded
gtqt.quest.db.1237.desc=Gadolinium is a silvery-white metal with ductility, a melting point of 1313°C, a boiling point of 3273°C, and a density of 7.901g/m3. Gadolinium is magnetic at room temperature. It is relatively stable in dry air but loses luster in humid air; gadolinium has the highest thermal neutron capture cross-section and can be used as a control and shielding material in reactors; ultra-low temperatures close to absolute zero can be achieved by magnetocaloric refrigeration using gadolinium salts. %n%nIn 1880, Swiss chemist de Marignac separated "samarium" into two elements, one of which was confirmed by Sorite to be samarium, while the other element was identified through the research of Boisbaudran. In 1886, de Marignac named this new element gadolinium in honor of the discoverer of yttrium and pioneer in rare earth research, the Dutch chemist Johan Gadolin (Gado Linium). Gadolinium will play an important role in modern technological innovations.

gtqt.quest.db.1239.desc=That's right, I think it's stupid to obtain it through fusion, I wonder if the GT5 people have studied nuclear physics. %n%nIn1901, Eugène-Antole Demarcay discovered a new element from "samarium" and named it Europium. This was probably named after the word Europe. Most of the europium oxide is used in phosphors. Eu3+ is used as an activator for red phosphors, while Eu2+ is used for blue phosphors. Y2O2S:Eu3+ is the best phosphor in terms of luminous efficiency, coating stability, recycling cost, etc. In addition, with the improvement of technologies to enhance luminous efficiency and contrast, it is being widely used. %n%nIn recent years, europium oxide has also been used as the stimulated emission phosphor in new X-ray medical diagnostic systems. Europium oxide can also be used to manufacture colored lenses and optical filters, for magnetic bubble storage devices, and can also play a role in control materials, shielding materials and structural materials in atomic reactors. Because its atoms can absorb more neutrons than any other element, it is often used as a neutron-absorbing material in atomic reactors. In addition, it can be used as a phosphor for color TVs, these phosphors emit a bright red color, used to make TV screens; laser materials, etc. %n

Since ancient times, it has been regarded as a gemstone. It is said that the word "Zircon" comes from the Arabic "Zarqūn," which means cinnabar, or from the Persian "Zargun," which means golden. "Hyacinth" comes from the Greek word for "lily." The island nation of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean is rich in zircon. Gems containing zirconium were known in ancient times in the form of zircon.

gtqt.quest.db.1290.desc=In 1787, Karl Arrhenius encountered an unusual black rock in an old quarry in Ytterby, near Stockholm (Sweden). He thought he had discovered a new tungsten ore and handed the sample over to Johan Gadolin, who lived in Finland. In 1794, Gadolin announced that it contained a new 'earth', which constituted 38% of its weight. It was called 'earth' because it was yttrium oxide, Y2O3, and could not be further reduced even after heating it with charcoal. %n%nThe metal itself was isolated independently in 1828 by Friedrich Wöhler by the reaction of yttrium chloride with potassium. However, there were other elements hidden within the yttrium. %n%nIn 1843, Carl Mosander more thoroughly studied yttrium oxide and found it to be composed of three oxides: yttrium oxide, which is white; terbium oxide, which is yellow; and erbium oxide, which is rose-red. %n%nYttrium is widely used in industry. It can be used as yttrium phosphors to produce red colors in television screens, and also in certain radiation filters, superconductors, superalloys, and specialty glasses. Yttrium is resistant to high temperatures and corrosion, making it suitable as a cladding material for nuclear fuel. Yttrium can form stable chelates with various amino carboxylate agents; yttrium aluminum garnet containing neodymium is an excellent laser material, yttrium iron garnet is an excellent laser material, and yttrium iron garnet and yttrium aluminum garnet are new magnetic materials.

The Philosopher's Stone is said to be the world's most potent catalyst, capable of turning stone into gold, triggering miracles, and even creating elixirs of immortality - as recorded and devoutly believed by ancient scholars. %n%nLegends about the Philosopher's Stone have never ceased since you began studying magic; however, theories on how to create this miraculous substance vary widely. Among them, apart from bizarre tales and fantasies, ancient mystics were in fact closer to the answer. %n%nIndeed, the §5soul infusion§r process is capable of producing powerful catalysts, but ancient mystics fell short in material science, and they couldn't fully compress the immense energy surging within modern machines into the materials they could obtain. On the other hand, they aimed too high, eager to synthesize the perfect Philosopher's Stone, forgetting that in mysticism, the more powerful the mystical effect, the higher the requirement it places on the vessel's mystical capacity. It's like forcing a child to act as an adult, which only leads to the opposite result. %n%nYou meticulously designed a synthesis route for the Philosopher's Stone: it is a process of continuously enhancing material quality, while its mystical properties ascend step by step. The first level of the Philosopher's Stone is only at the black earth level, yet it can already guide many catalytic reactions that conventional catalysts cannot, with potential for further growth. Its synthesis combines cutting-edge scientific and magical technologies. %n%nYou have now unlocked a series of powerful formulas!
gtqt.quest.db.1354.title=Steel of the Earth
gtqt.quest.db.1354.desc=Terra steel produced using traditional methods will be of great use in the future！
gtqt.quest.db.1355.title=Occult Production Line？
gtqt.quest.db.1355.desc=Regrettably, the potential of conventional materials reaches its limit here. Manshu steel is indeed the most excellent mana-conducting material, but it itself is still confined by its own mundanity, and cannot fully arrive at that non-material world overflowing with mana. If you wish to create a miracle never before achieved by any mystics, you will need a substance that fundamentally "theoretically does not exist" within this world. %n%nAncient alchemical theories hold that §6gold§r is the most perfect metal, but this mystical "perfection" has its limitations. This limitation is that it is only perfect in §l§othis world§r, and not in §l§oevery possible world§r. From this, you conceive of a metal that perhaps achieves mystical "perfection" in every possible world, and that metal is §6§lEngraved Gold§r. %n%nIn your existing world, "completing" base metals into gold is already no easy feat, how much more difficult would it be to "complete" them into a completely new metal that does not exist? Yet, you have created the most powerful magical catalyst apparatus in history, and you believe its energy is barely sufficient to allow you to cross this threshold. You believe that once you cross that threshold, a brand new world lies ahead. %n%n§8This is the darkness before the dawn, children.§r
gtqt.quest.db.1356.title=Modern Alchemy Line-2-Essence Purification
gtqt.quest.db.1356.desc=Infuse mundane materials with a spark of spirit. This step does not require pure magic, for base lead cannot yet bear it.
gtqt.quest.db.1357.title=Modern Alchemy Line-3-Ascension Part One
gtqt.quest.db.1357.desc=The First Ascent, the one who renounced abundance traversed the vast wilderness, silently turning the orbits of stars. %n%nAncient alchemy sought to transmute lead into a new metal, while you took lead as a waystation on your journey.

gtqt.quest.db.1362.title=A Residue
gtqt.quest.db.1362.desc=Reclaim the residue, and you can obtain all the lead. The sublimated vapor derived from refinement is merely a gas in the alchemical sense, with little connection to the physical world.
gtqt.quest.db.1363.title=Second Residue
gtqt.quest.db.1363.desc=Precious impure magic can be recovered from the secondary residue. This magic can no longer participate in more advanced alchemical processes now.
gtqt.quest.db.1364.title=The Modern Alchemy Line - 8 - Flowing Metal Transmutation
gtqt.quest.db.1364.desc=Mercury is the only metal that flows, being one of the three alchemical bases and one of the seven fundamental metals. Extra caution is required when handling it. %n%nYou need to add world salt again.
gtqt.quest.db.1365.title=Modern Alchemy Line-9-Layered Purification
gtqt.quest.db.1365.desc=The purification process is almost purely physical. The chemical and physical properties of the materials remain unchanged before and after, but the mystical significance begins to shift.
gtqt.quest.db.1366.title=Modern Alchemy Line-10-Ascension III
gtqt.quest.db.1366.desc=Ascension III, the apostles of God roam freely across the three realms and four seas, as the sun and moon wax and wane.%n%nMercury not only purifies magical elements but also enhances their plasticity.
gtqt.quest.db.1367.title=Modern Alchemy Line-11-Gaining Momentum
gtqt.quest.db.1367.desc=Now comes the part about iron, which is extremely complex. Iron is the metal most known to mankind, so it's very difficult to surpass this level.%n%nYou need to showcase all your skills, as the mana inside the material has become quite unstable now.

gtqt.quest.db.1373.title=The Fourth Residue
gtqt.quest.db.1373.desc=These mana residues are already overwhelmed and can only reclaim various magical materials with a small probability.
gtqt.quest.db.1374.title=Modern Alchemy Line-16-Elixir Refining
gtqt.quest.db.1374.desc=The addition of materials from an alternate world turned the liquid you stirred into a clear, magical potion. %n%nAs you progressed further, the closer you got to the source, the more magical elements appeared.
gtqt.quest.db.1375.title=Modern Alchemy Line-17-Boiling Tea by the Hearth
gtqt.quest.db.1375.desc=Add salt to extract the essence from the solution.
gtqt.quest.db.1376.title=Modern Alchemy Line-18-The Thrilling Leap
gtqt.quest.db.1376.desc=The carp leaps over the dragon gate, and the path to greatness becomes clear. %n%nYou need to construct a magical catalysis reaction, which is the only crucial step that requires magical catalysis during the process. %n%nThis step must be catalyzed by your Sage's Stone, which is still in its infancy.
gtqt.quest.db.1377.title=Modern Alchemy Line-19-The Fifth Ascension
gtqt.quest.db.1377.desc=The Fifth Ascent, the pure white seashells birth pearls of beauty, their gaze naturally evokes pity.%n%nCopper is the metal that represents the beautiful things of the world, transcending this metal causes your materials to soar. Now, you are not far from success.
gtqt.quest.db.1378.title=Five Residues
gtqt.quest.db.1378.desc=The last two residues are entirely different from the previous ones, able to yield an immensely precious substance through centrifugation... We call it §l§oMansus Matter§r.
gtqt.quest.db.1379.title=Modern Alchemy Line-20-Special Treatment
gtqt.quest.db.1379.desc=After five ascensions, in fact, you are already capable of creating a very powerful alloy, which is equivalent to a functionally weaker but more versatile carving gold. It has already broken through the boundaries of dimensions. Discarding this new silver metal is an essential step, and this metal itself is a byproduct.%n%nYou need otherworldly blue stones to smelt this metal.
gtqt.quest.db.1380.title=Modern Alchemy Line-21-High Temperature Smelting
gtqt.quest.db.1380.desc=Calcinate the unstable dimensional silver at extremely high temperatures and fully mix it with gas to construct a flow of magical energy.%n%nThis is a highly magical reaction that cannot be achieved with a conventional furnace!
gtqt.quest.db.1381.title=The Line of Modern Alchemy-21-The Art of Silver Cleaning
gtqt.quest.db.1381.desc=Use World Salt to extract the priceless mithril from hyperspace. %n%nThis metal can be used on its own or further processed into orichalcum. With its incredible magical affinity, it will undoubtedly become the primary raw material for machinery in the next era.
gtqt.quest.db.1382.title=Modern Alchemy Line-22-The Sixth Ascension
gtqt.quest.db.1382.desc=The Ascension VI, invoke the weeping meteor on the dark side of the moon to unveil the secret portal.%n%nAbandon the mithril vessel here and enact the final ascension.
gtqt.quest.db.1383.title=Modern Alchemy Line-23-True·Magical Transformation
gtqt.quest.db.1383.desc=The last two steps of crafting carved gold are quite straightforward and need not always be performed. %n%nFirst, you need to mix two types of Mansus substances with mana and sublimation vapor to create dimensional modificator. This is a low-consumption substance, you don't even need to build a dedicated production line for it. %n%nUsing dimensional modificator, you can transform gold into carved gold, achieving great accomplishments.
gtqt.quest.db.1384.title=Modern Alchemy Line - Final Product - Culmination of Virtue
gtqt.quest.db.1384.desc=You succeeded!%n%nA higher realm has opened up to you, Ascendant, prepare yourself!

gtqt.quest.db.1386.title=No to the Age of Decay, Yes to Jingwei Filling the Sea
gtqt.quest.db.1386.desc=In ancient texts, you read that there used to exist things called \"spirit nodes\" in this world, but due to the catastrophe of intersecting worlds or some mysterious pollution, these spirit nodes no longer exist at all. You think that although natural spirit nodes no longer exist, creating them might not be entirely impossible. %n%nThe machine you designed represents the true unveiling of new mysticism. Its principle is unbelievably crude—you pour in an immense amount of energy to forcibly create spirit nodes that didn't originally exist and then seal them. On the other hand, without the aid of a Philosopher's Stone, its cost is almost unbearable. %n%nEach spirit node is unique, with its six elements completely randomized, and it possesses its own node type and node strength. You believe that \"bright\" and \"voracious\" nodes are among the most precious and valuable. %n%nYou are still exploring the uses of these spirit nodes. You think they have immense potential...
gtqt.quest.db.1387.title=The Final Form of Clean Energy!
gtqt.quest.db.1387.desc=Using nodes for power generation is a very clean and incredibly powerful option! As long as you carefully select the best nodes, you can achieve 8-digit power generation with this reactor, without the need for complex fuel production lines.%n%nThe machine's mechanism for utilizing nodes is quite complex. Simply put, different node traits determine the power generation multiplier, while the amount of fire and order elements in a node determines the power output. Additionally, if a node contains an excessive amount of chaos elements, its power generation efficiency will be very low!%n%nThis powerful generator now even supports laser chambers.
gtqt.quest.db.1388.title=Next Generation \"Enchanting\"
gtqt.quest.db.1388.desc=You have grown tired of the excruciatingly slow infusion process that utilizes low-grade magical elements, but you cannot completely replace it, as it contains the metaphysical \"will\" of mysticism. However, although you cannot entirely forgo infusion, it is possible to surpass it in certain aspects.%n%nYour first next-generation magical device is an assembler. It retains a vestige of the previous generation's machines, yet it is also different. You have drafted a series of innovative designs for magical equipment, and it can significantly reduce the cost of energy consumption.%n%n§6§lThis wondrous machine requires you to have made some achievements in botany beforehand, being able to manufacture Terrarium Steel at the very least.§r
gtqt.quest.db.1389.title=§5§lInfinite Forging...
gtqt.quest.db.1389.desc=If there really were celestial entities in this world, the furnace they use would be nothing more than this...%n%nThe greatest achievement of neomysticism so far is this forging furnace, which truly realizes alchemy instead of leaving it on paper. Now, most physical elements and magical alloys can be easily refined.%n%nThe previously obtained nodes were smelted all at once, producing countless kinds of Mansus substances that old mystics have long dreamed of: they represent the projection of the spiritual world in the material world and cannot be obtained in large quantities by conventional means. The only way to produce Mansus substances in batches is to crush the nodes.%n%nYou begin to wonder if developing neomysticism to this extent has gone too far?
gtqt.quest.db.1390.title=Little Maid
gtqt.quest.db.1390.desc=You feel that large-scale magic catalytic equipment is a bit too bulky, and the high-precision chemical reactions required by traditional industry are also giving you a headache.%n%nYou plan to practice and design a cute little magic chemical plant to solve this problem.
gtqt.quest.db.1391.title=Bulk Smelting
gtqt.quest.db.1391.desc=You no longer need to use complex production lines to produce advanced alloys. Additionally, the synthesis of some Botania alloys has also been unlocked.
gtqt.quest.db.1392.title=Supreme Miracle: The Rite of Chalk
gtqt.quest.db.1392.desc=The production of the Philosopher's Stone is extremely difficult. It can only be achieved using your latest furnace, and even if you input the correct Mysterium substances (which no previous Mystic has ever been able to obtain), the leap to higher quality is not always successful.%n%nYou feel that the production process will become even more difficult in the future.

gtqt.quest.db.186837971.desc=GCYM Among the added multiblock structures, except for the Alloy Smelter, Electric Implosion Compressor, and Industrial Steam Turbine, all support the parallel control hatch. %n%nThe maximum parallel number can be adjusted within the GUI. %n%nMechanism: Set the recipe base power as P0, the maximum allowed input power of the multiblock machine as Pm, and the maximum parallel number determined by the parallel control hatch as N0. Then the actual parallel number N=min(N0，floor(Pm/P0)), and the total base power PTB=N×P0. %n%nIf the parallel control hatch limitation causes 4n<Pm/PTB<4n+1, the machine will perform n additional overclocks. %n%nFurthermore, when the recipe’s voltage tier equals the multiblock machine’s voltage tier, the parallel control hatch becomes ineffective, meaning the machine will process only one recipe per single run. %n%nExample: 16 L molten europium + 1 partial crystal chip raw material >>>>>> 1 crystal chip raw material, with a base power of 480 EU/t and a base duration of 600s. %n%nThe multiblock High-Pressure Reactor is equipped with a parallel control hatch, powered by an IV Energy Hatch (maximum input power of 8192 EU/t × 2A = 16384 EU/t) %n%nWhen the maximum parallel number is set to 8, the power is 15360 EU/t, and the duration is 300s (one additional overclock); %n%nWhen the maximum parallel number is set to 9, the power is 4320 EU/t, and the duration is 600s; %n%nWhen the maximum parallel number is set to 89, the power is 16320 EU/t, and the duration is 600s (due to the machine’s energy hatch limitation, a single run can process at most 34 recipes).

gtqt.quest.db.286565807.title=Steam Power Generation, but Multiblock
gtqt.quest.db.286565807.desc=This is a multi-block that very closely resembles real-life steam power generation. As long as there is enough steam, it can generate a lot of electricity. %nNote that the rotor will continuously consume durability, and do not stick your head into the machine while it is running! %n=====================================%nLarge Turbine %nLarge Turbines are divided into Large Steam Turbines, Large Gas Turbines, and Large Plasma Turbines. The Large Turbine is a multi-block generator that can be built starting from the HV stage. Compared to single-block generators, Large Turbines have higher efficiency and more impressive output, making them almost essential power generation equipment in your GT journey. The blocks that make up these three types of turbines are slightly different, as shown in the table below: %n======================================%nTurbine\t   Casing Block\t           Middle Block\t                             Construction Phase %nLarge Steam Turbine         Steel Turbine Machinery Block         Gear Machinery Block\tHV %nLarge Gas Turbine\t   Stainless Steel Turbine Machinery Block Stainless Steel Gear Machinery Block\tEV %nLarge Plasma Turbine Tungsten Steel Turbine Machinery Block      Tungsten Steel Turbine Machinery Block\tLuV %nIn addition to the above differences, the biggest distinction between these three turbines is the fuel they consume. %n%nLarge Steam Turbines consume steam to generate electricity and convert steam into distilled water at a ratio of 160:1. Under default settings, 1mb of steam = 0.5EU. %nLarge Gas Turbines consume combustible gas to generate electricity, and the specific fuel values can be checked in JEI. Without mods or add-ons, the fuel with the highest calorific value is nitrobenzene, which generates 1280EU per 1mb. %nLarge Plasma Turbines consume plasma to generate electricity, and plasma can only be produced by a nuclear fusion reactor. Specific values can also be checked in JEI. %n%nTurbine Mechanism %n%nLarge Turbines require a rotor to be placed into the rotor holder (note that the front of the rotor holder must be a 3*3*1 air block) to function: %nFuel Amount: As the name suggests, it refers to the amount of fuel in the input hatch. Obvious. %nRotor Speed: The turbine can only reach maximum energy output when the rotor speed is full. %nTurbine Efficiency: This actually refers to fuel efficiency. For example, in the case of a steam turbine, when the turbine efficiency is 200%%, 1mb of steam can generate 1EU. It is influenced by multiple factors (see below). %nEnergy Output: The amount of electricity generated by the turbine, which is also influenced by multiple factors. %nRotor Durability: As the name suggests. Rotor durability does not affect efficiency or output; when durability reaches 0, the rotor disappears, and turbine power generation stops. %nMaximum Power: Note that this is different from maximum energy output, as it is only related to the dynamo hatch. For example, the maximum power of an EV4A dynamo hatch is 2048*4=8192EU/t. If the maximum power is less than the maximum energy output, the turbine's maximum power generation will be limited to the maximum power, so higher-tier dynamo hatches should be used whenever possible. %nFactors Affecting Turbine Efficiency and Maximum Energy Output %n%nThe rotor holder has a minimum tier requirement, then hover the mouse over the controller. %nFor every tier above HV, turbine efficiency increases by +10%%. %nFor every tier at HV, maximum energy output is multiplied by 2. %n%nEach rotor has two percentage values: Rotor Power and Turbine Power. Rotor Power is related to turbine efficiency, while Turbine Power is related to maximum energy output. %n%nCalculation Formulas: %nTurbine Efficiency = Rotor Power * [(Rotor Holder Tier - Minimum Required Tier) * 10%% + 1] %nMaximum Energy Output = Base Power Generation * Turbine Power * 2^(Rotor Holder Tier - Minimum Required Tier)

gtqt.quest.db.1603136494.desc=Usage%n%nThe Energy Storage Substation can be used to store and distribute electricity. %n%nThrough the GUI of the Energy Storage Substation, you can know the maximum energy cache value, passive energy consumption rate, current total input and output power, and estimated time remaining until fully charged (if input is greater than output) or depleted (if output is greater than input). %n%nOperation Mechanism%n%nThe total energy cache of all battery blocks that make up the Energy Storage Substation is the energy cache of the substation. The substation uses Java's BigInteger class to handle power data, allowing it to manage power sums exceeding (263 - 1) EU. The Energy Storage Substation assigns a number starting from 0 to each battery block that constitutes it in a certain order. When storing energy, it preferentially stores it from the battery with the lowest index value. When consuming energy, it preferentially consumes it from the battery with the highest index value. %n%nDuring the normal operation of the Energy Storage Substation, a tiny amount of stored energy is passively consumed every moment, amounting to 1%% of the total energy cache being consumed every real day. The upper limit of power loss caused by each capacitor is 100,000 EU/t.
